  - The Triplet Suns
---
Raki, Raor and Rila are the triplet suns of [[Acora]]. They are true gods but after Rali's murder they no longer interact with humans with the exception of their most loyal followers in their [[Oracles of the Twin Suns|monasteries]]. The murder of Rila is what kept the twins from interfering when [[the Bruqai]] took over. Their monasteries are still under protection however. 

These were the first gods of [[Acora]] and came to be due to the nearly universal sun worship across both continents at the time. Nomads spread the names Raki, Raor and Rila in what's now known as Valdor. Other names were common in other places but the worship was the same which allowed them to manifest as true gods.

The disinterest from the gods towards humanity has lead to worship of other gods with Godswrath in particular being a reason for the large purge in their number of followers. The whole devotion to worship that their monasteries bring has allowed them to cling to godhood, but only barely.

### Rila's Death
Rila was once one of the suns permanently in the sky with her twin brothers. In these days the summers were much longer and hotter and the winter's were mild and snowless. When people's crops failed to grow due to the droughts they demanded answers from the gods of the sun. Rila decided to go with them to quell their anger. When she took human form, the third star in the sun dimmed and the heat waned. The townsfolk blamed her for the drought and wanted to make sure she couldn't return to her kingdom to condemn them to their famine. So they captured her and the townsfolk used every means they could to kill her though none worked. The greatest minds in the village came together to devise a weapon powerful enough to kill a god. They realized only a god could kill a god. They also realized that they could inflict damage and pain on her even if they couldn't kill her.

So they cut off her arm at the elbow and carved her ulna and radius in two bladed shortsword they called [[the Godthorn]]. They then used this sword to pierce her through the heart. She becomes a burning ball of flame that extends out into the heavens and into her star. The sky is engulfed in a white light that extends across all of [[Acora]]. It lights up the night sky on the other side of the planet before dimming as the third sun explodes into brilliant purple light. It creates a brilliant nebula surrounding the other two suns that's faintly visible during the day and the most visible on a clear day during the winter. This nebula is known as Rila's Scar.

### Raor and Raki's Revenge
To avenge the murder of their sister, every year they exert a significant amount of their energy to have all life on [[Acora]] to pay the price for their sister's loss. They focus their light on the rings of [[Acora]] which is reflected back onto the planet, greatly increasing the surface temperatures. This concentrated light looks like a third sun in the sky which is meant to remind humanity what they took from them. During this time heatwaves, droughts and wildfires are rampant.
