**Number of Followers:** 1.2 million (primarily in [[Pyril]])

**Subject of Worship:** Dirt, stone, metal, and the unseen veins of ore that run beneath the land. Worship is directed toward the spirit of the stone and the living pulse of the mountains.

**Alignment:** All alignments

**Typical Worshippers:** Miners, blacksmiths, masons, jewellers, and stonecutters. Occasionally farmers too living on poor soil. These farmers may not worship the eternal wheel if the seasons are good, but their soil isn't.

**Symbols:** Hammers crossed over a mountain peak.

**Typical Devoutness:** Moderate. Daily prayers and offerings are common among miners and smiths before beginning work. Major rites occur during the first mining of a new vein and the smelting of newly discovered ore. Devoutness is highest in those looking for new veins and lowest in those working on old ones.

**Background:** The Stonebound Creed emerged in early [[Pyril]], long before its protectorate status under [[Grudor]]. As miners unearthed riches from the earth, a belief developed that the land was a living force, granting gifts to those who showed proper respect and punishment to those who were greedy or careless. Legends speak of "Earthwounds," places where reckless mining angered the stone spirit and caused deadly collapses or cursed veins. The Creed teaches that every pickaxe blow, every stone removed, must be balanced by reverence and gratitude. Temples of the Stonebound Creed are simple but enduring â€” carved into cliffsides and deep within mines. Every mine has a shrine to the Creed at it's entrance. Miners are expected to make an offering after a days work. The Creed remains a uniquely Pyrilian faith, with limited spread outside of their mountainous homeland, though visiting merchants sometimes adopt minor rituals when dealing in Pyrilian ore and gemstones.

Many Pyrillians also worship what they call The Stonemother which is who places the veins, carves  the mountains and saves miners from cave collapses. Belief in the Stonemother has been banned by [[the Bruqai]] so was in turn banned in [[Pyril]] for fear there would be another manifestation leading to deification. The Stonemother does not exist yet though and mountains and ore veins were created naturally.
