**Background:** Was once the most popular religion in [[Acora]] when hunting and gathering was more common than agriculture. After the sundering it's growth has been slow as advancements in animal breeding have lessened the need to hunt for food. It's followers are also not as devout as their counterparts in the Eternal Wheel as they are more nomadic people who could make no use of a church.
