There are currently no gods on [[Acora]]. Before the Sundering, the people were simple and had not yet reached the point of personifying creatures to revere. Nor were there any heroes recognized and worshipped enough to reach godhood. They worshipped things in their daily lives they needed to survive like plants, animals, the sea and seasons. Organized worship is still a new concept with the first true organized religion coming shortly after the Sundering with the Oracles of the Twin Suns. They were also the first to personify their deitie, but their rigor prevents enough followers from joining to grant these icons any real power.

After the Sundering with the advances of technology, less and less people had to rely on the natural world for their living. Irrigation made the coming of the rains less important, more powerful fishing boats made the fish stocks in an area less of an issue. This has lead to worship of these religions out of pure necessity less common. Now these religions are largely worshipped, especially by those in urban areas, because of the less tangible things they represent. The Sanctum of the Sea has many coastal worshippers in awe of the beauty of the waves that believe they must hold some additional power. The Children of Root and Claw have a growing number of followers who find peace and tranquillity in nature that believe their must be a divine force behind that. There are also new religions cropping up such as The Divine Arc that were created with no necessity, but out of the awe inspiring nature of the rings and people believing there must be some greater power responsible for its creation. These religions are almost exclusively the domain of city dwellers who have no need of the natural world in their livelihoods and want to separate themselves from the rural people and their "primitive" beliefs.
 
The [[Neurqai|Neurophages]] and Strength Bruqai encourage this development. This is because of the advancements in both social structure and war that religion can bring. However, all [[the Bruqai]] as a whole are wary of letting religion grow to the point of deification because they know that would spell their demise. As a result any religion that deifies an individual is monitored closely and quickly quashed if it grows too large.
 
Divine intervention still works, but it's not the elements of nature themselves that intervene. For a brief moment, the cleric can channel all of the unfocused energy worshippers from across [[Acora]] create and use it to empower themselves to perform a godlike act.

[[Calythra]] had a group of scientists create a god by creating and spreading myths about a god of knowledge over 300 years they proved this god existed once he reached 5000 followers as a demi god and at 10000 followers he achieved true godhood.
