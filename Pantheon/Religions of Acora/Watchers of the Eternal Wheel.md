**Background:** The watchers of the eternal wheel is a new religion in [[Acora]]. It was created after the Sundering when agriculture grew in popularity and importance. It eventually overtook the previous most popular religion, The Children of the Root and Claw. It's very popular among farmers who's livelihoods depend on the regularity of the seasons, so they worship this cycle of death and rebirth they call the Eternal Wheel.
 
It's the most popular religion in [[Acora]] because it appeals to the most frequent profession and doesn't require the level of servitude other old religions need such as the Order of the Twin Suns.
