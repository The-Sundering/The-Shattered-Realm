The Dawnforge is the Acoran name for the force that permeates every corner of the universe and provides magic. This religion is the most common one in [[Turul]] and the official one of the Arconate. This is the only state religion in [[Acora]]. Turulian scholars believe [[Acora]] of one of the sources of creation with [[Turul]] specifically harbouring most of this magical energy.

Magic is apart of creation and permeates every corner of the universe and is apart of its very fabric. It concentrates more in some places while some areas have dead zones of magic. Some areas with special properties can be sources of creation. These are hypothesized to be areas that have been there since creation. Others are wells that suck in all magic and seemingly destroys it.

They also believe in a deity called the Forgemaster that was the creator of the Dawnforge and in turn all of [[Acora]] and the universe as a whole. This Forgemaster does exist. Many of them do did and the Dawnforge hotspots are where they weived reality into creation as they created the Dawnforge and the universe as a whole. The formed the suns, the planets and crystal spheres along with the laws of the universe to allow others to form on their own. DF deadzones are areas where the light of this creation has not yet spread to, but the spheres and systems in these zone formed naturally from what these Forgemasters created. As their final gift to their creation, they take their own life essence in order to bring about life. They then nestle themselves in the heart of their planet and this is what provides the force energy that is able to be used externally. Worship in these forgemasters can redirect enough energy into them to awaken as true gods. These gods are the most powerful there are in the universe so [[the Bruqai]] will not under any circumstances allow one to be awoken.

Any talk of the Forgemaster is considered heresy and punishable by life imprisonment. This is preferable to death because death penalties are intenstionally public. Believers are usually killed by guards quietly in prisons before they can spread their rhetoric to others.

A forgemaster could destroy [[the Bruqai]] on its own while any other true god would need help to completely rid the world of [[the Bruqai]] because their sheer force and numbers.
