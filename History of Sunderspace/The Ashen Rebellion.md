The Ashen Rebellion was a war that raged 100 years between the Draekai empire and all the nations of [[Acora]]. It was started by [[Turul]] as their magic had grown strong enough to put up a fight against Draekai invasion. [[Turul]] recruited the help of the other nations of Wraekai to fight back against the empire. Once [[Calythrahra]] joined, they enlisted the help of [[Magnarch]] and [[Pyril]] to fight on their continent too.

Over the years as [[Turul]] grew in its power and importance in the war they formed the Archonate. The need to protect Wraekai from the Drakai threat was enough to allow them to grab the power they needed to cease control over [[Waymarch]] and [[Vitos]].
