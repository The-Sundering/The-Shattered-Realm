## **Rules**
Firearms can't be found or made on [[Acora]]. They can be brought with you from other planes, but if they're lost, need repair or additional ammunition, that can't be found on this world.

There's a homebrew race that is the aberrant version of a tiefling and a language called [[the Bruqai]] that this race gets. You can learn this language but it's very rare so you have to have a character reason as to why you would know this language. Some examples would be raised by aberrant tieflings, servant to [[the Bruqai]], Bruqai scholar.
