- You learn two manoeuvres of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a manoeuvre you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the manoeuvre's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
