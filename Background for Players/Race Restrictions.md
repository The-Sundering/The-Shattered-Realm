[[Acora]] is a world with limited magic and no means of traveling outside of the planes. Other beings can travel from other planes to [[Acora]] if they know about the world. Creatures from other crystal spheres can also travel from their worlds to [[Acora]] which is free to enter since their sphere is currently fissured. There are no race restrictions if the character has some means of travelling to [[Acora]] from another region where these races are prevalent.
 
Below are the allowed and disallowed races with ties to other planes of existence. Any creature from one of the disallowed races can be played as long as the backstory makes sense. You can use the explanations from the allowed races as inspiration. Lore established in official material related to the planes is valid here and can be used to explain why your race is present on [[Acora]].
 
Most races can be allowed if your character travelled from their plane of existence to [[Acora]] or are descended from someone who did. If you want to have some other origin, as long as it makes sense for the world it'll likely be allowed.
 
All creatures from other planes are exceedingly rare. You're still allowed to play them, but if you aren't one you likely haven't seen one before.

**Allowed Races With Other Explanations**  
Aasimar - The first castings of celestial summoning spells resulted in celestials being permanently brought into [[Acora]]. Aasimar are direct descendants of these celestials or those blessed by them in some way.
 
Aarakocra - On [[Acora]], Aarakocras did not originate from the elemental plane of air. Similar to how humanoids descended from ape-like ancestors, Arakocra descended from bird-like ancestors.
 
Eladrin - Once every few centuries, an Eladrin city from the feywild crosses over the prime material plane and becomes present on [[Acora]] for several months. Many Eladrin leave the city to join the people of [[Acora]]. Those from these cities and their descendants are present in this world.
 
Kalashtar - In 134 BSU, ten quori fled the plane of dreams and sought shelter among monks in the Order of the Sun. These quori joined with these monks and became the first Kalashtar in [[Acora]]. Current Kalashtar are descendants of these monks.
 
Tabaxi - Tabaxi from [[Acora]] descended from cat-like ancestors and were not created by the Cat Lord. Tabaxi from other regions can be created by the Cat Lord.
 
Tieflings - The first castings of demon summoning spells resulted in demons being permanently brought into [[Acora]]. Tieflings are direct descendants of these demons or those cursed by them.
      

**Disallowed Races**  
The Disembodied - Travel to the ethereal plane is not yet possible by magical means. If you have an explanation as to how they traveled to and got trapped in the ethereal plane than it's allowed.
 
Warforged - [[Acora]] isn't advanced enough to create the warforged. They are allowed if you can explain how they got to [[Acora]] and why.
