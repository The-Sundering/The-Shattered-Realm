Anything from the following list of books is allowed without additional approval for character creation. This includes optional rules:
2014 Player's Handbook
Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
Xanathar's Guide to Everything
Fizban's Treasury of Dragons
Modenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

Backgrounds from any WOTC setting or campaign book is allowed as long as they make sense in the world and for your background. 

Homebrew and books not listed above may be allowed, just run it by me first.
## **2024 Rules**
We will be using 2014 base rules for D&D, everywhere except for where otherwise indicated. You will be using the 2014 rules for character creation, but if you would like to use a 2024 class, sub class, feat or spell just let me know and I'll approve it as long as I don't think it will affect balancing. 2024 backgrounds are not allowed.

#### **2024 Base Rule Adoptions**
#### Exhaustion Rules
We'll use 2024 exhaustion rules instead of the 2014 ones because they're easier to follow. The 2024 exhaustion rules are as follows:

| Exhaustion Level | d20 Test Penalty | Speed Reduction |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1                | -2               | -5              |
| 2                | -4               | -10             |
| 3                | -6               | -15             |
| 4                | -8               | -20             |
| 5                | -10              | -25             |
| 6                | Death            | Death           |
