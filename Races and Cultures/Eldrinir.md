Eldrinirs are humanoids who bear the touch of [[The Bruqai]], marked by their connection to these aberrant beings. Despite their heritage, Eldrinirs aren't inherently malevolent. Some embrace their Bruqai heritage, using their innate abilities for knowledge, magic, or influence. Others reject their aberrant nature, striving to maintain their humanity and live ordinary lives. In [[Acora]], Eldrinirs are viewed with a mix of suspicion and fear. Their unpredictable and often disturbing appearances make them targets of mistrust. Most see them as a living reminder of [[the Bruqai]]’s influence, while some believe their unique traits might hold the key to understanding—or even escaping—the lingering presence of [[the Bruqai]].

#### Treatment
They are not born naturally but are created through direct interaction with [[the Bruqai]]. One common origin for an Eldrinir is through a deliberate transformation—a gift bestowed by [[the Bruqai]] themselves. For those who serve [[the Bruqai]] loyally, particularly members of [[The Bruqai Brotherhood]], becoming an Eldrinir is considered the highest honour. [[The Bruqai]] view resemblance to themselves as a mark of greatness, and they reserve this transformation for those who have proven their unwavering loyalty. In [[Deslea]], where Eldrinirs are seen as the highest form of humanoid existence, individuals touched by the [[Neurqai]] are celebrated rather than shunned.

Outside of these loyal circles, Eldrinirs most often come into being by killing a Bruqai. In their dying moments, some Bruqai choose to mark their killer, infusing them with a trace of their power as an act of spite. This transformation is both a curse and a mark of guilt. [[The Bruqai]] view such Eldrinirs as traitors or murderers, and any other Bruqai who encounters them will seek to kill them. Among humanoid societies, reactions vary. If an Eldrinir is transformed in front of witnesses who recognize the sacrifice involved, they may be honoured as someone who took on a terrible burden for the community. But in most places, they are viewed with fear, mistrust, and even open hostility, treated as monstrous outcasts.

Eldrinir traits are hereditary, passing to any children they bear. A child born to an Eldrinir will inherit their aberrant nature, though it may mix with the traits of their other parent. This inheritance is a source of shame and fear for many communities. To knowingly have children as an Eldrinir is seen as a disgrace, a deliberate continuation of a corrupted bloodline. In some regions, such children are shunned, and their parents are viewed as a threat to the community’s purity.

#### Appearance
Each Eldrinir displays different aberrant traits, a reflection of their connection to [[the Bruqai]]. Some have inky black skin that seems to absorb light, while others have translucent, veined skin with shifting patterns beneath the surface. Horns, ridges, or twisted growths may emerge from their bodies, but their forms vary—some have branching, crystalline structures, while others have bony, jagged protrusions.

Eyes are equally diverse. Some Eldrinirs have a single, large eye dominating their face, while others possess eyestalks that extend and swivel. A few have solid, glowing eyes of green, violet, or deep black. Limbs may take on unnatural shapes—tentacles, clawed appendages, or segmented forms. Some have flesh that ripples or pulses with a life of its own, while others display a mix of features, such as chitinous plates alongside smooth, rubbery skin.
