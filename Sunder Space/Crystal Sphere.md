Everspace is a crystal sphere that has never been exited. It was entered once when [[The Bruqai|creatures]] from the Far Realm came to [[Acora]]. See [[The Sundering]]

It has 2 suns named Raki and Roar on [[Acora]]. They're both G5V stars which are yellow dwarves slightly smaller than our sun. [[Acora]] orbits 1.26 AU from them. The system is a p-type circumbinary system with the two stars orbiting each other and the other planets in Sunder Space orbiting them.
