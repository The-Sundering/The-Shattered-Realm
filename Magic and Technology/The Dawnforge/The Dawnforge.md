The **Dawnforge** is the primordial energy of creation. It is the force that allowed something to come from nothing—the spark that crystallized the first matter, energy, and laws of existence into being. Where physics leaves the cause of the Big Bang unknowable, the Dawnforge is the answer in this universe: the wellspring of creation itself.

Unlike fundamental forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, the Dawnforge is not required for the universe to persist. Once matter and energy are created, they follow the familiar laws of physics without needing a constant supply of Dawnforge energy. Instead, the Dawnforge is best understood as a force that enables _creation events_. It builds, destroys, and reshapes. Once something exists, it continues under natural laws, but the Dawnforge can add, subtract, or reconfigure.

## Origins and Spread

The Dawnforge did not erupt from a single point. Instead, multiple **hotspots** of Dawnforge energy flared simultaneously across the early universe, each acting as a self-perpetuating furnace. It's creations spread out across the universe until they intersected; merging each section together. Dawnforge energy has a unique property: when in high enough concentration, they create more of themselves. This makes these hotspots effectively endless, their fires burning for billions of years and radiating outward in great streams of energy.

From these furnaces, Dawnforge energy flows through space in great rivers winding across the cosmos. The closer one is to a furnace, the stronger the saturation. At the edges, the currents fray into faint strands and eddies, until eventually the Dawnforge thins out into nothingness.

Some regions of the universe are Dawnforge-rich, with dense rivers of energy shaping their worlds. Others are sparse, with only faint trickles that fade quickly. Entire regions may exist as Dawnforge voids, with no trace of the energy at all.

## Why Acora Radiates

[[Acora]] lies close to one of these Dawnforge furnaces, bathed in its currents since its formation. The planet’s very matter—its crust, oceans, and atmosphere—was steeped in Dawnforge energy as it took shape. This made Acora not merely a world within the current, but a **sink-turned-source**, a planet saturated to the point that it radiates Dawnforge back into the cosmos.

This saturation is what allows Acora to be a world of magic. Dawnforge bleeds from its mountains, hums in its weather, and coils through its seas. The planet itself is an endless reservoir of energy, stable because it was forged in a Dawnforge-rich region.

## Why Living Beings Radiate

Life on Acora evolved in this saturated environment. From its earliest beginnings, biology formed with Dawnforge currents woven into it. As a result, all living beings on Acora radiate faint Dawnforge fields. This radiation is not required for survival, but it is an inseparable byproduct of life that developed in such an environment.

Conscious beings developed a specialized brain structure called the [[Forge Node]], connected to the amygdala. The forge node does not generate Dawnforge energy but instead channels and regulates both the personal field and ambient currents. For most, it remains vestigial, only producing a weak aura without conscious control. For some, the node develops further, allowing them to manipulate their own field and the wider energy currents of the Dawnforge.

Thus, Acorans radiate Dawnforge simply by existing. The [[Forge Node]] is what allows them to consciously wield it.

## Currents of Creation

The Dawnforge does not flow as a single undifferentiated force. Instead, it manifests in countless unseen **currents**, each representing a fundamental aspect of existence. These are the building blocks of magic, woven into patterns by those with the will and knowledge to shape them.

Some of the known currents include:

- **Decay** – entropy, corrosion, endings, and destruction.
- **Light** – illumination, revelation, purity, and radiance.
- **Force** – pressure, impact, and raw kinetic power.
- **Change** – transformation, adaptation, and flux.
- **Movement** – speed, travel, momentum, and flow.

Casters combine and shape these currents through their forge nodes, forming unique spell-patterns that anchor the Dawnforge into the material world. A fireball, for instance, is a pattern of _Force_ and _Decay_, shaped into a sphere and channeled into flame.

The deeper one’s understanding of these currents, the greater their ability to manipulate the Dawnforge. Intuitive casters feel them instinctively, while intellectual casters dissect their structures and recombine them with precision. Together, they form the backbone of all magic on Acora.

## Analogy to Electromagnetism
Humans and other animals produce their own electromagnetic fields. For humans in particular, this is through the movement of charged particles throughout the body. Electromagnetic fields interact with each other and human fields can (weakly) interact with other fields. This technically also includes the magnetic field of the Earth. It's said that Qi energy may be the ability to control these fields. One study has shown that Qi masters have been able to tangibly alter the magnetic field of a coil magnet. Thus deep study of these processes can result in mastery of them even when the thing being studied isn't the direct cause (analogous the clerics or druids controlling magic through devotion to gods or nature). Thus it may be true that if one were to deeply study exactly how these changes in electromagnetism in the body works and how to bring them on, it's theoretically possible for them to develop the same or perhaps an even greater ability to manipulate these fields than Qi masters who may not be fully optimizing their EMF manipulation capabilities (wizards being the most powerful magic users). Some species are able to use these fields to do serious harm such as electric eels because of specialized organs in their body that can produce them. Thus some creatures may be born with the ability to control them to a high degree without even training to do so (sorcerers).

The ability to learn this would be somewhat akin to Tummo meditation which is the result of rigorous training of the mind and body to withstand cold temperatures. It's likely that this has an effect on the body's EMF as well. It take 3 - 6 months of rigorous training to be able to achieve it at all. This would be akin to learning a cantrip. It takes 5 - 10 years to become a master in it and increase your body temperature (and likely your EMF) significantly which is akin to becoming a levelled wizard.

## Connection with the Dawnforge
Every caster has a conscious connection with the dawnforge that they can use to manipulate it. For most casters that cast through emotion, the dawnforge is mostly a feeling and instinct. As you grow in power you're able to call more from it as you connect to it deeper. It brings you closer to the subject that brought you this power in the first place, a druid can feel the energy running through the natural world and can understand it's components on more of a spiritual level than an intellectual one (vibe casting).

A wizard connected to the Dawnforge understands exactly how it works so they don't connect with it intuitively, but intellectually. The dawnforge is made up of energy currents unseen to the naked eye that rush around creation. These currents correspond to different aspects of creation such a decay, light, fire, force, change and movement. Each school of magic is a specific combination of these aspects for example the school of evocation is a combination of decay and force currents. These combined currents are then shaped into specific patterns which is unique to each spell. Spell patterns define the effect of the spell. For example, fireball is shaped into a large ball with flame licks when combined with the domains of force and decay creates the burning ball of fire. This pattern then needs to be chanelled to bring it from the dawnforge to the material plane. The various spell components channel the spell from the dawnforge to this plane by creating paths of least resistance through the wizard's own forge energy. This is how wizards are able to be so much more powerful that other casters and create their own spells. Other casters due this intuitively but wizards understand exactly what it is they're doing.
