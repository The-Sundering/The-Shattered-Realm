## Cosmic Currents

The most fundamental source of magic comes from the **raw Dawnforge currents** that flow through creation itself. These are the rivers of energy left behind by the original furnaces of creation, still streaming through the universe. On Acora, these currents mingle with the planet’s own reservoir, producing a limitless well of energy.

All casters tap into these cosmic flows to some degree, but **wizards** specialize in them. Through study and discipline, they learn how to isolate, shape, and recombine these raw streams with precision. Where others “feel” the currents, wizards dissect them, giving them access to the most versatile and complex spells.

## Natural Resonance

The second source of Dawnforge energy is found in the **living world itself.** Every organism radiates a faint Dawnforge field, whether plant, beast, or microbe. On Acora, these countless fields overlap, blending with the natural energies of life until they are inseparable. The result is a great web of living Dawnforge energy that permeates forests, rivers, and skies.

This is the power that **druids and rangers** attune themselves to. By deep communion with the natural world, they learn to harmonize with this living resonance, drawing strength not just from the Dawnforge currents but from the pulse of life itself. Their spells reflect this symbiosis: growth, healing, animal bonds, and primal fury.

## Collective Devotion

The third source comes from **conscious beings**. Though most people have vestigial forge nodes, their emotions still cause them to radiate Dawnforge energy in small, unfocused amounts. When pooled together through shared devotion or worship, these scattered sparks become torrents of energy.

This collective force condenses into divine avatars — the gods. They are not separate from the Dawnforge, but rather **manifestations of it**, formed from the concentrated reverence of mortals. **Clerics** channel their power from these avatars, while **paladins** forge personal oaths that anchor their node to unwavering devotion. In both cases, emotion is the bridge that binds mortal hearts to divine current.

## Internal Mastery

The fourth source comes from **within the individual.** Every conscious being has a personal Dawnforge field, weak but ever-present. Through training, instinct, or natural affinity, this personal current can be mastered.

- **Paladins** perfect this path, binding their will to an oath that sharpens their node into a disciplined channel.
- **Sorcerers** are born with an enlarged, active node, giving them a natural mastery without effort.

Martials too, in a lesser way, manifest echoes of this source. They do not consciously wield Dawnforge energy, but their will and emotions resonate through their nodes, producing feats beyond mundane capability. This is not spellcasting, but rather a **passive amplification** of their natural abilities.

## Magical Dead Zones
In a magic dead zone, there's still the natural forge energy the caster produces to draw on along with the energy of those around them. This still decreases their power unless they're sufficiently trained to draw on their own magic and not rely on the larger forge for casting. A mage will always be more powerful with external sources of magic. You can't cast spells over level 5 in these deadzones. This can be avoided if you have 2 non-casters within 10 feet of you that you can harness magical energy from. Enemies do count but only if they radiate Dawnforge energy as well. Casters can be used as a source, but this would provide disadvantage on all magical attack rolls and advantage on saving throws to anyone targeted by one of the spells of the caster being used as a source.

## Wild Magic
Wild magic is a manifestation of the Dawnforge interacting with the prime material plane without any form of interaction from a caster. This is rare, but when it does happen it's very often dangerous though temporary. It occurs when Energy currents collect and focus in one area. Enough of these currents concentrated in a small enough space generates enough power to be channelled into our plane without being shaped or anchored by a caster. This causes random magical effects in the area as different currents twisting in different shapes come together. 

The largest wild magic source on [[Acora]] is [[The Serpent's Maw]] in the middle of the serpent's maw. It's an island covered with a permanent wild magic storm and is the only place where travellers from other planes regularly come from. It's also the only place where gates to other planes can be opened.
