There are 13 months that are 28 days each so the year is 364 days long with no leap years. The calendar was created by [[Grudor#History|Drakai]] and spread to Wraekai during their limited conquest of the continent before [[Turul]] had mastered their magic. All of the area specific events are in relation to the Drakain capital . 

Beginning of summer is something akin to Rali's birth/rise where the sun reflection (3rd sun) thats larger though fainter than the 2 suns becomes visible for much of the day

The end of summer is Rali's death/fall where the sun reflection disappears for the last time.

At the beginning of fall there would be one month darkness. Then for 4 months of winter there would be a twilight gloom. For one month as winter ends and spring begins there would another month of darkness.

### Months
##### Spring
Month 1 - Light's Return
The end of winter and beginning of spring where the shadow ring has fully passed and things begin to warm up.

Month 2 - Florentide
When plants and trees begin to grow and flower.

Month 3 - Sowing Sun
When the weather begins to get warmer and seeds begin to be sowed by farmers.

##### Summer
Month 4 - Stormswell
Hot and humid weather begins. The first harsh summer storms of the year begin.

Month 5 - Rilamir
The weather gets hotter and the rings are positioned correctly in respect to the sun to create ring reflections that result in what looks like a third sun appearing in the sky bigger than either Raor or Raki.

Month 6 - God's Wrath
Hot and dry weather with lots of thunder that leads to droughts, heatwaves and wildfires. The ring reflections intensify this heat. This is the month where the [[Raki, Raor, and Rila#Raor and Raki's Revenge|twins' wrath]] is in full force as they make [[Acora]] suffer for their sins.

Month 7 - Rilathorn
Summer's end where the heat ceases being as intense and the crop begin to be harvested. Rila disappears as the sun's reflection is no longer as strong.

##### Fall
Month 8 - Goldbough
The weather cools down and begins to get a bit chillier. Crop harvesting is the most intense. Leaves begin to turn.

Month 9 - Rednight
The leaves begin to change as the temperature cools further. The month long night begins 

Month 10 - The Gloom
The end of fall when all the leaves have fallen off the trees, the weather has gotten colder and the mild ring shadow blankets the sky. This leaves a perpetual dark and gloomy similar to dusk or a very cloudy day.

##### Winter
Month 11 - Flake Fall
The beginning of the winter when the snow and frost begins.

Month 12 - Frost Grave
Deep winter with the worst storms and weather. Blizzards are very common and can drop a metre of snow.

Month 13 - Evernight
The end of winter, but the coldest month due to the ring shadow blocking out the sun and bringing another eternal night.

### Days of the Week
Days of the week are based on the emperors of [[Grudor]] that were in power between 58 SU when they became an empire and 78 SU when they conquered Wraikai.

Day 1 - Maldas

Day 2 - Taidas

Day 3 - Wardas

Day 4 - Tyrdas

Day 5 - Fekdas

Day 6 - Seerdas

Day 7 - Drakdas

### Eras
Acora has two eras: the Age of Shelter (AS) which was before [[The Sundering]] and the Fractured Age (FA) which was after it. 









### [[Acora]]'s Rings
[[Acora]]'s rings cast shadows on the planet. This shadow is similar to a very cloudy day or dusk, but is not as dark as night. 

The rings would be anchored around the equator so the tilt of the rings would be the same as the axial tilt of the planet.

There would be a moving band of light going across the planet as light from the rings is concentrated in different places. This beam would almost look like a third sun. 

Around [[Grudor]] the sun would go behind the rings for four months at the miod fall to later winter.

In the summer, there would be no ring shadow, but the winter's would create the ring shadow. The reflection of light from the rings to the Earth would create warmer summers while the shadow would create colder winters.

At the equator the rings are a thin line and at the poles they'd be a barely visible arc in the horizon. In the Northern and Southern hemispheres the rings in the night sky would light it up greatly , but wouldn't be fully visible since the shadow of the earth would pass by it as the night progresses.

The shadow grows between the summer and winter solstice due to the tilt of the Earth.

By March 20th, the rings are edge on and the shadow disappears as it's directly in line with the rings at the equator. This only lasts for a day after which the shadow begins moving south. It's very thin by this point. By March 27th, the rings grow larger and continue south. They're 3 distinct shadows by this point with light in between the ring shadows. By April 7th they cover much of the southern hemisphere. By April 26th, one ring only covers the south pole while the other 2 rings still cover much of the southern hemisphere as they move south. By may 10th, there's only 1 ring visible on the southern hemsiphere while the other 2 rings converge at the south pole. The strength of the ring shadow has greatly diluted. By June 3rd there's only a faint ring circling the south pole. By June 14th the rings are not visible at the south pole. By July 16th, a faint ring moves north from the south pole. By August 2nd, the second ring moves up from the south pole. The third ring becomes visible by August 12th and the rings are stronger while covering more of the equator. By August 30th the rings are strong at the equator and all 3 are clearly distinct. The rings begin converging by September 5th as they move north towards the equator. The rings converge more and cover a smaller portion of the southern hemisphere by September 10th. By September 23rd the rings are edge on again and disappear at the equator.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the shadow at the latitude around [[Grudor]]'s position would start Oxtober 10th and and on March 10th lasting 6 months overall. The strong shadow band would last a month where there would be nearly as dark as night with a few days of breaks as the different shadowbands pass. This would be in October. After that you'd have a weaker shadowband that's more a a cloudy day in terms of the light it blocks that lasts until february when the band returns strongly until march.

When the ring shadow is invisible on Septermber 23rd there's a large parallel gap in the rings from the shadow of the Earth that would be visible at night. This gap becomes smaller and moves west until it becomes a small hump only covering s portion of the inner most ring. On December 31st it beings growing again until march 20th when the ring gap becomes parallel again.

The band leaves gaps so there are 3 sun shadow stripes until they converge at the poles.
