Most countries except [[Calythra]], are secretly loyal to [[The Bruqai]]. If they banded together with all the technology they've been given and developed, they could reasonably put up a decent fight against [[the Bruqai]] on the ground and they don't want that. In return for their obedience, the Bruqs continue to advance their civilizations. The leaders just explain this as their smart teams of experts making these new advancements. [[Calythra]] is progessing more slowly but also more honestly. They need to invest more in development to keep the pace with their rival nations.
