Orcs make up much of the military in [[Acora]] and are the most common race to be stationed at outposts around Calythra. They are the dominant race that man the Calythrian Shield so many towns built near the shield have predominantly Orc populations.

Rock gnomes are the masons responsible for the bulk of the Calythrian supply of stone. They largely live on mountains and carve out chunks and shaped them as needed before shipping them to where its needed using the more advanced shipping technology provided by Freepier to Calythra.

Kobolds are emigrants from [[Pyril]] that came to Calythra during the Ashen Rebellion for refuge. In return they provided Calythra with knowledge of the advanced tunnelling practices they use in [[Pyril]] to create mines and underground cities. These tunnels are maintained and expanded today to link Stonespire to the walls and various points around Calythra. These tunnels are primarily done through mountains as a quick means of transportation in and out of the city.
