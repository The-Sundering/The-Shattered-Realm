There's a small minority of sea based creatures (Tritons, Sea elves, Hadonsee). These groups are holdovers from when they were a dominant race in Waymarch responsible for seafaring. Many left in the initial expeditions to Grayshore. After they were expelled by Waymarch's architect, they were no longer considered welcome in Graymarch. This led to many fleeing persecution by building their own illegal ships or stealing ships from official docks. It's nearly impossible for them to get work so they are forced to steal to get by. Many actively try to sabotage Waymarch by selling private designs to other countries resulting in them being punished by the Gearforged Tribunal.
