## Geography

#### Regional Divisions
- **North Deslea:** Frozen tundra, glacial valleys, scattered mining outposts
- **South Deslea:** Wetlands, temperate forests, medicinal herb regions, larger settlements

#### Climate
- Northern regions: Subarctic to arctic; brutal winters, short summers
- Southern regions: Cool-temperate; long, wet seasons with heavy fog and mild summers

#### Terrain and Landscape
- Glaciers, permafrost fields, and icy cliffs dominate the north
- Dense wetlands, mossy forests, and meandering rivers shape the south
- Numerous geothermal springs provide rare warmth and medicinal mineral deposits

#### Notable Locations
- **The Weeping Woods:** Southern forest famed for medicinal herbs and rare fungi
- **The Sunken Mire:** Treacherous wetlands, home to powerful medicinal plants and dangerous beasts
- **The Gates of Mourning:** The chokepoint between the Armored Crests where Deslea has fought back Turulian assaults in the past. It has been fortified using Calythrian technology and is guarded at all hours since it's the only way to enter deeper Deslea except through [[Calythrahra]].

#### Flora and Fauna
- Flora: Frostbloom flowers, bloodroot vines, silverleaf moss (used in poultices)
- Fauna: Ice wolves, marsh elk, glacial bears, bog vipers
- Domesticated animals: Hardy goats and reindeer adapted for northern climates

#### Environmental Hazards

## Government

#### Government Type
- Scientific republic governed by a rotating council of physicians, scholars, and engineers

#### Nobility and Privilege
- No hereditary nobility; status is earned through academic or scientific achievements
- Medical titles (Doctor, Scholar, Master Healer) are more respected than political ones

#### Capitol City
- Frostfall

#### Crime and Punishment
- Deslea is a very level headed region. They're not much for violence and are softer on crime. 
- One primary punishment for the most severe crimes is stripping of status and intellectual work. 
	- Being forced to be a simple labourer for the rest of your life as a former scientist or doctor is one of the worst fates that could happen to a Deslean. 
- They care about more serious crimes that put them at risk of losing their sovereignty or the intellectualness of their society.
	- Spreading disinformation is one of the most serious crimes you can commit.
		- Severe disinformation that affects a large section of the society is one of the very few crimes that has the death penalty.
	- Advocating for changes that could lead to more violence such as a larger military is another serious crime.
	- Talking badly about [[the Bruqai]] is one of these crimes. They're considered the smartest beings in Deslea that deserve respect in order to get more knowledge, any action that could drive them away or draw their hostility is one of the most grave offenses in Deslea.
- Smaller crimes are dealt with through education on the consequences of the crime. 
	- When this doesn't work, criminals are held in research institutions where their criminal behaviour is studied and multiple experimental approaches to solving crime are tested on them.
- Violent crimes are also very serious and few exceptions are made cause any violence is considered a grave sin against Deslea.
	- Those found guilty of committing them are used as subjects for experiments before testing on typical humans is allowed. 

#### Allies and Adversaries
- [[The Bruqai]] are their primary allies. 
- Strong trade alliance with [[Calythrahra]] and Freepier
- Strong opposition towards both [[Turul]] and [[Grudor]]

#### Infrastructure
- Outside of major cities, Deslea’s infrastructure is functional but basic, designed for survival rather than comfort.
- Trade routes are minimal and rely on natural riverways, marsh causeways, and sled paths across the tundra.
- Fortifications are rare except at critical points like the Gates of Mourning, where the natural mountain pass is lightly fortified and constantly monitored.
- The majority of Deslea's architectural investment is directed into its libraries, universities, and centers of learning.
- Major universities and archives are built to withstand both environmental hazards and the slow passage of centuries, often becoming cultural centers around which towns and cities develop.
- Most residential and commercial buildings in Deslea are modest, made from insulated stone, timber, and peat, prioritizing durability over aesthetics.

#### Military
- The Deslean military is comprised almost entirely by Calythrian troops lead by scholars in military history and strategy.
- These scholars rarely do any actual fighting but strategize where infantries are placed to protect critical resources while avoiding conflict.
- Rarely a Deslean will join these infantries, but it's frowned upon.

## Economy

#### Bruqai Bestowment
- Gifted the first medical techniques, advanced herbalism, early scientific research methods, and printing technology
- [[Neurqai|Neurophages]] in particular are incredibly intelligent beings since they feed on the intelligence of other creatures. As a result, they're highly respected in Deslea because of all of the knowledge they have and give to the people of Deslea. This is the only place on [[Acora]] where [[the Bruqai]] are celebrated and welcomed. Though this only really happens in cities. [[The Bruqai]] still need to feed and choose to do so on remote rural communities with few connections to others. This allows them to keep their stronghold on Deslea and advance them faster than any other race of Bruqai. Since there's no secrecy in terms of advancements, Neurophages can have a heavier hand in pushing for their advancement. Anyone speaking out against this is accused of blocking progress and is tried for it.

#### Natural Resources
- Medicinal herbs and fungi
- Small but valuable deposits of alchemical minerals

#### Trade, Guilds and Market
- The Apothecaries’ Consortium regulates all herb and medicine trade
- Southern trade hubs specialize in rare medicinal exports and scientific equipment

#### Technology and Medicine
- Most advanced medical science in [[Acora]]
- Developed techniques for disease prevention, basic surgery, herbal pharmacology, and rudimentary prosthetics
- Early printing presses allow widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge

#### Transportation and Communication
- Sled and reindeers are used as the primary means of transportation in the north.
- Most transportation is done on foot in the south.
- There's a rudimentary postal system used primarily for shipping books and news around Deslea. It relies on the detailed maps cartographers have made of the country and couriers who know the regions they service well.
	- Losing or stealing mail shipped in this way is a serious offence.
- Deslea has managed to replicate the wheel so it's commonly used on the roads of central Deslea. Though much of the country is still inaccessible to this form of transport because of the poor road infrastructure.

#### Farming
- Limited to southern wetlands
- Crops include hardy root vegetables and medicinal plants
- Lots of research being done into improving farming techniques

#### Export/Import
- Major exports: Medicinal herbs, treated bandages, healing potions, scientific treatises
- Major imports: Luxury goods, food staples, building materials, military troops, labour

## Culture

#### Art and Entertainment
- Literature, scientific exploration, and academic debate are primary pastimes
- Ice-sculpting festivals are popular during rare celebrations

#### Architecture
- Built low and insulated against the cold; domed stone structures common
- Southern settlements favor stilted, wooden architecture to rise above marshes

#### Ethics
- Knowledge, precision, and preservation of life are paramount values
- Disinformation is a grave offence
- Lack of scientific curiosity and contentment with simple menial labour is greatly frowned upon

#### Fashion and Dress
- Thick furs, insulated wool, and heavy boots in the north
- Waterproof cloaks, layered tunics, and practical leathers in the south
- Scholars wear distinctive colored sashes denoting their field of study

#### Holidays
- **Day of First Light:** Celebrated after the long polar night ends in northern Deslea. Symbolizes bringing enlightenment into a time of darkness. Communities carry around lamps and read the newest papers from their local libraries to stave off ignorance.

- **Festival of the Healing Waters:** A southern Deslean festival held annually to honour the marshes, rivers, and wetlands that provide vital medicinal plants.  Includes herb-gathering competitions, free healing clinics run by scholars and apprentices, and public thank you to physicians and healers. New medical apprentices are often formally inducted during this festival.

- **Rose Spring:** A solemn day marking the day [[Turul]] attacked Deslea and the Deslean forces held them back at the Gates of Mourning. Many soldiers lost their life that day. It's remembered with a candlelight vigil with many making their way to the gates to pay their respects. Soldiers are given the Widow's rose on this day. A delicate black flower that only grows on the mountains of the Armoured Crests.

#### Education
- Deslea is one of the few countries that educates its children from a young age. Children start school at age 4 and continue until they're 17. They're expected to go to university afterwards and not doing do is shameful.

## Customs

#### Religion
- Deslea has no dominant organized religion with many believing them to be unscientific.
- Many rural communities follow the Children of Root and Claw, especially foragers looking for medicinal herbs.
- There are some small pockets of the Eternal Wheel in northern Deslea as people seek relief from the harsh winters.

#### Religious Tolerance

- Faith is seen as a personal matter, secondary to the pursuit of knowledge and survival

#### Secularism
- Government, education, and law are firmly secular
- Religious practices are separate from civic institutions

#### Temples
- Few formal temples exist
- Shrines to the Root and Claw are common in rural areas

## Magic

#### Laws on Magic
- Magic is legal and encouraged in Deslea
- Every major university has a section for magic with one magic university existing in Frostfall, the only one outside of [[Turul]].
- The only form of magic that is banned is planar magic. Though this is still commonly practiced by many scholars in secret. This magic is banned because [[the Bruqai]] doesn't want any intervention from other planes.

#### Magical Tolerance
- Without Turulian knowledge, they are significantly less advanced in these matter, but the scientific method has allowed them to make the greatest headway than any other country.
- Healing magic is their speciality and a primary focus at universities. They've caught up to [[Turul]] in this regard and are beginning to over take them. 
- People are comfortable around magic, though are feverently against any form of destructive magic.

#### Magic in Warfare
- Every infantry has at least one magic user that specializes in healing magic
- Otherwise, magic is strictly forbidden from being used in warfare.

## History
Deslea's harsh climate and distance from the great powers of [[Grudor]] and [[Turul]] allowed it to survive early imperial expansions. After receiving [[the Bruqai]] bestowment of medicine and science, Deslea developed into the continent's foremost center of healing and knowledge preservation. While once ignored by the great powers, Deslea’s mastery of medicine has made it an increasingly critical player in political and trade negotiations.

#### The Breaking of the Crests
100 years ago, as [[Turul]] began to see the value Deslea would bring to the Archonate, they invaded the country through [[Vitos]]. They needed to pass through the slim passage between the Armoured Crests in order to do that though. It was only after some scouts had made their way through the gates to the nearest villages where they were alerted to the assault. These villages sent messages by foot, sending stones and the message spell to everyone that would listen and thus began The Breaking of the Crests. From around Deslea, every able bodied person took up arms, carrying anything they could use as a weapon and began the Silent March towards the gate. It's said that no one spoke to each other during rh entire march there. The event was solemn, not necessarily for fear of death, but the dread of losing every value they hold dear. There had been no violence in Deslea since they were given their bestowment. A core part of Deslean identity was non-violence and that identity was being shattered.

Wave after wave of Desleans came to the gate, weapons in hand. While they were less equipped than the Turulian soldiers, the chokepoint gave them the advantage they needed to battle of the forces of [[Turul]]. The canyon meant that the Turulian soldiers didn't have the line of sight needed to cast most of their spells. The Desleans that lived by the Crests shared maps with those from elsewhere so they would have a good understanding of the terrain. They hit amongst stones and crags to avoid detection and dropped boulders and enemy forces. Those good with ranged weapons acted as snipers shooting down enemies who had no means of firing back. There was also a heavy frontline that stopped anyone who tried coming through the gate. This was the most dangerous position and resulted in the most deaths.

Finally, on the 7th day of Seedwake after 32 long days of battle, the hoards of Turulians stopped coming and the battle had been one. Not without much loss though. On this day, the first shoots of what was then called Widow's rose began to sprout around the bodies of their fallen comrades. With the help of [[Calythra]] a gate had been erected in the canyon called the Gate of Mourning. Fresh Widow's Rose is kept there year round and it's constantly guarded in case of another attack. Rose Spring is remembered each year as the day these flowers sprout and the end of the Battle of the Crests.

They continue to guard their independence fiercely, relying on harsh geography, scientific superiority, and strategic alliances to remain free.
