## Geography

#### Regional Divisions
- Divided into five agricultural provinces: Greenveil, Riverrock and Sunplain.

#### Climate
- Vitos is tropical and warm year round. It frequently rains especially in the rainforests of the coasts. The inland meadows don't see as much rain, but it's enough to keep crops well watered with limited need for irrigation.
- For 3 months as the ring shadow passes over Vitos, the weather cools and allows for a harvesting season.
- During full shadow which lasts a month, the temperature drops to 5 - 10C. Light drops to the equivalent of the floor of a rainforest with a thick canopy, light still makes it's way through, but only the most shade tolerant plants can grow in these conditions.
- Half-shadow happens for 1 month before and 1 month after full shadow. Light gradually decreases than increases with the average light being equivalent to partial shade. 
- The light season is called zenith and the dark season is called umbra.

#### Terrain and Landscape
- Rolling fertile plains
- Sparse, low forested areas along rivers and the north-eastern coasts of Sunplain
- Abundant river systems for irrigation
- Gentle hills and no mountains
- Mostly flat

#### Notable Locations
- The Verdant Bowl (vast central farmland basin known for legendary crop yields)
- The Silverflow River (major irrigation source and trade route)

#### Flora and Fauna
- **Staple Crops:** Rice, maize (corn), sorghum, cassava, and various beans
- **Native Fruits:** Bananas, mangoes, papayas, guavas, and citrus fruits (oranges, limes)
- **Other Agricultural Plants:** Sugarcane, coffee, cotton, taro root, yams, peppers, peanuts, and sunflowers
- **Wildlife:**
  - **Common Grazers:** Antelope, wild boars, feral cattle
  - **Predators:** Foxes, jungle cats (small leopards), large birds of prey
  - **Domesticated Animals:** Water buffalo (for field work), goats, sheep, chickens, and pigs
- **Natural Vegetation:**
  - Tall grassland ecosystems dominate the landscape between farmlands
  - Occasional tropical woodlands and riverbank forests
  - Fields of wildflowers bloom during the start of the Harvest Sun season

#### Environmental Hazards
- Seasonal floods during monsoons at the beginning of Zenith
- Occasional magical blights on crops (especially in fields too close to unstable Turulian artifacts)

## Government

#### Government Type
- Provincial republic under Turulian dominion
- Local governance managed by a council of provincial governors
- Foreign affairs, magical regulation, and major trade agreements are overseen by [[Turul]]-appointed officials

#### Nobility and Privilege
- Traditional nobility faded after farming collectivization
- Wealthy landowners hold local power, but must defer to Turulian mandates in external matters
	- These are given the title of Landlord or simply Lord
- Social tensions exist between independent farmers and merchant-backed plantation owners favored by [[Turul]]
- Those with the most bountiful harvests are quick to grow to nobility as people go to them to seek advice to improve their own harvests.

#### Capitol City
- Oxmeadow

#### Crime and Punishment
- Petty crimes typically punished by fines, crop levies, or community service
- Severe crimes are punished with forced labour on the farms of nobility.
	- Some nobles pay off local police to maintain a steady flow of prisoners for their farms and plant evidence to charge them for crimes they did no commit.
	- Sabotaging crops is one of these major crimes
- As with all countries, being a warlock of [[the Bruqai]] is punished by death here. This is under jurisdiction of the Archonate however so all those accused are sent to them.
- Theft of magical crops or interference with trade is harshly punished under Turulian law
- Magical crimes investigated by Turulian envoys assigned to Vitos

#### Allies and Adversaries
- Formal dominion under [[Turul]]
- Is not allowed to trade with [[Grudor]] or any of her protectorates.
	- Some farmers manage to sneak shipments out through secluded piers deep in the jungles of Greenplain
	- This is punishable by life imprisonment by the Archonate if caught
	- Provincial lords without loyalty to the Archonate typically make much of their money this way.
- No direct alliances with [[Calythrahra]] or [[Deslea]], but maintains cordial trade relations

#### Infrastructure
- Extensive irrigation systems sourced from the Silverflow River
- Well-maintained trade roads connecting farming provinces
- River barges dominate transport between smaller settlements
- Infrastructure projects requiring magic (e.g., large aqueducts) must be approved by [[Turul]]

#### Military
- Small, lightly armed local militia for internal policing and protection of farmlands
- Defense against major threats is the responsibility of [[Turul]]'s military
- Local forces trained to act quickly against banditry, raiding, or sabotage

## Economy

#### Bruqai Bestowment
- Gifted the first farming techniques, enabling unrivaled agricultural productivity
- Advances in crop rotation, irrigation engineering, and selective breeding of plants

#### Natural Resources
- Fertile soil
- Freshwater access

#### Trade, Guilds and Market
- Dominated by the Agrarian Society (an alliance of major landowners and trade houses)
	- In order to trade at any official market, you must sell your crops first through the Society where they charge high fees and increasingly lower their sell rate while increasing the rate they charge at
- The Sovereign Farmer's Guild is a smaller guild of farmers trying to give independent farmers a larger share of the market.
	- They want to do away with dominance by the Agrarian Society and have trade be equal and fair for everyonf.

#### Technology and Medicine
- Highly advanced agricultural technology
- Limited general technological innovation outside farming
- Relies on trade from [[Deslea]] for its more advanced medicines
- Simple first aid techniques and herbs are the only things used outside of Deslean imports

#### Transportation and Communication
- River barge system supplements rural trade routes
- Major cities connected by well-built roads
- Communication relies heavily on courier networks

#### Farming
- The agricultural powerhouse of [[Acora]], Vitos supplies the majority of the continent's staple foods and produce.
- **Major Crops:**
  - **Grains:** Rice, maize (corn), sorghum
  - **Fruits:** Bananas, mangoes, papayas
  - **Vegetables:** Yams, cassava, sweet peppers
  - **Cash Crops:** Sugarcane, cotton, coffee
- **Less Common Crops:**
  - Oranges, limes, avocados, peanuts, taro root, okra, beans (various kinds), melons, sunflowers
- **Harvesting:**
  - Most major grain crops (especially rice and maize) are harvested once per year at the end of the Growing Rains.
  - Fruits like bananas and papayas can produce multiple harvests throughout the year.
  - Root vegetables (like cassava and yams) are staggered, allowing for secondary minor harvests during the dry season.
- **Farming System:**
  - Fields are rotated between wet and dry season crops to maintain soil fertility.
  - Irrigation from the Silverflow River supports some limited dry-season planting of fast-growing crops.
  - Crops typically are planted together with a diversified appraoch as opposed to a monoculture
- **Cultural Importance:**
  - Farming is deeply tied to identity. All the most important people of Vitos are known for having the best land and the most bountiful harvests.


#### Export/Import
- Major exports: grains, fruits, vegetables, livestock
- Major imports: magical components, fish, and medicine

## Culture

#### Art and Entertainment
- Storytelling and agricultural festivals dominate cultural life
- Competitive farming contests are common community events

#### Architecture
- Simple, functional structures emphasizing stone foundations and wide timber roofs
- Grand grain halls and communal meeting houses in larger settlements

#### Ethics
- Croplands are regarded as the highest good in Vitosian society; protecting and maintaining productive farmland is considered a moral obligation.
- Natural, untamed spaces hold little cultural or ethical value unless they can be cultivated; wild lands are often seen as opportunities for expansion rather than resources to be preserved.
- Crimes against crops and livestock (theft, sabotage, deliberate neglect) are considered extremely serious, punishable by forced labour on Agrarian Society-controlled farms.
- Soiling, poisoning, or otherwise rendering farmland infertile is viewed as one of the most heinous crimes in Vitos, equivalent to treason; perpetrators face severe, often lifelong punishments.
- Wealth and status are strongly associated with ownership of fertile land and successful harvests; landowners dominate social and political life through the Agrarian Society.
- Trade outside the official Agrarian Society channels is illegal, though small farmers often resist quietly, especially through secretive trade with [[Grudor]] despite the risk.
- Hatred toward [[Grudor]] is widespread among commoners, fueled by fears of conquest and economic exploitation; trading with [[Grudor]] is illegal but persists underground.
- Relations with [[Turul]] are largely neutral; [[Turul]]’s oversight is tolerated so long as they do not interfere with Vitos’s control over its croplands and internal affairs.
- Community among small farmers often centres on mutual protection of fields and goods, serving as an informal counterbalance to the Agrarian Society’s monopolistic control.


#### Fashion and Dress
- Practical clothing: linen shirts, woolen tunics, sturdy boots
- Festival attire features brightly embroidered patterns representing crops and rivers

#### Holidays
- Harvest's End (largest celebration, marking the end of the growing season)
- First Planting Festival (blessing of the fields and communal feasts)

---

## Customs

#### Religion
- The dominant religion in Vitos is the [[Watchers of the Eternal Wheel]], centred on the direct worship of the seasons and the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth.
- [[The Children of Root and Claw]] maintain a minor presence, especially among isolated rural families, though their reverence for untouched nature is less compatible with Vitos’s intensive farming culture.
- The [[Disciples of the Dawnforge]] are present through Turulian influence, focusing on the magic of creation itself, but they are viewed as distant and largely irrelevant to the practical farmer’s life.

#### Religious Tolerance
- Highly tolerant provided that other faiths do not interfere with agricultural practices or dishonor the rites of planting and harvest.
- Religious disputes are rare, though accusations of crop curses or blighted fields can cause localized tensions.

#### Secularism
- Religion is woven into daily and communal life through festivals, planting rites, and seasonal ceremonies, but has little influence on governance.
- Secular leaders, primarily landowners and trade officials, wield true political power in Vitos.

#### Temples
- Temples to the Eternal Wheel are built in large farming settlements, serving as centers for community gatherings during planting, harvest, and seasonal transitions.
- Small countryside shrines mark significant natural landmarks: springs, crossroads, or particularly fertile fields, where offerings are left to honor the forces ensuring a bountiful harvest.

## Magic

#### Laws on Magic
- Magic use outside licensed agricultural purposes is restricted
- Possession of magical artifacts is strictly forbidden and is punishable by life imprisonment in [[Turul]]

#### Magical Tolerance
- Moderate tolerance: magic is accepted if practical and helpful
- Distrustful of overtly destructive magic (evocation, necromancy)

#### Magic in Warfare
- Extremely limited
- Defensive enchantments on grain stores and irrigation systems common in the farms of Lords anf those with close ties to [[Turul]]
- Battle magic is rare and imported (Turulian battlemages if needed)

## History
- Vitos was granted the first farming techniques by [[the Bruqai]], setting it on a path of agricultural dominance.
- Fearing devastation of its fertile land, Vitos negotiated peaceful trade agreements instead of engaging in wars.
- Over centuries, Vitos evolved into a key food supplier, forming critical alliances with [[Turul]] and remaining neutral in broader conflicts.
- Continues to grow as a quiet but indispensable force in [[Acora]]'s political landscape.
