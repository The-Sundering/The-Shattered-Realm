### Divine Conception
**Level:** 5th  
**School:** Evocation
**Casting Time:** 1 hour
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a blessed silver thread, two drops of blood from each participant, and a pearl worth 500 gp which is consumed)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Classes:** Cleric
#### **Description:**

You call upon divine power to bless the union of two willing humanoids, regardless of sex or fertility, with the ability to conceive a child that is genetically theirs. The targets must be touching (typically holding hands) for the duration of the casting. As the spell concludes, glowing threads of divine energy pass between the two, intertwining their essences.

The caster must choose one of the individuals to carry the child. If the chosen parent is biologically capable of pregnancy, gestation proceeds naturally. If not, a temporary magical womb is created within them, sustained by divine energy for the duration of the pregnancy. After birth, this womb is harmlessly reabsorbed or expelled.

Alternatively, the caster may conjure a Sanctified Cradle, a large suspended glass orb filled with softly glowing green fluid, capable of incubating the fetus externally. This cradle exists in a sanctified space of the casterâ€™s choosing and requires regular clerical upkeep (1 hour per week of prayer and care) to remain stable. This can alternatively be done by any of the parents.

The pregnancy lasts for the typical gestation period for the dominant species of the child. The child is born healthy unless complications would arise due to supernatural interference or curses. This spell overcomes natural infertility, including age-related infertility and medical sterility, but not magical effects (e.g., curses, undead biology, divine prohibitions).

This spell does not work on unwilling participants or those whose physiology prevents them from interacting with divine magic (such as constructs or undead).
