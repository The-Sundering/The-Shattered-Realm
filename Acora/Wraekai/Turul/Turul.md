## Government

#### Government Type
With no gods, divine soul sorcerers are incredibly rare and essentially the only way to be one is to have come in contact with an angel. Since angels have never willingly visited [[Acora]], this is not likely. There have been celestials with a handful being permanently conjured centuries ago when Summon Celestial was first cast. The only way to get divine soul is some form of interaction either directly or ancestrally with these celestials. The majority of "divine soul" sorcerers in Turul are lying. The most common form of sorcerer by far are aberrant mind sorcerers as magic was directly imbued in hundreds of people in Crystal Shore shortly after the Sundering. Being an aberrant mind sorcerer however is a death sentence or at least political suicide. SO these sorcerers prove their sorcery through meta magic but prove their divine soul lineage by (mechanically) multiclassing as a cleric. Lore wise, it's through intense worship of the Dawnforge that imbues one with simple cleric spells. The unfaithful can't even manage this so use tricks like a hidden wand used to cast cleric spells. 

With essentially all of the top members of the Archonate being aberrant mind sorcerers, there is no true opposition to [[The Bruqai]] in Turul. They get all their power from [[the Bruqai]] and they have made it very clear any form of resistance will result in that power being taken away. For those without the smarts to be a wizard or lineage to be a sorcerer, they become warlocks though are careful about the spells they use in public ensuring they only cast ones either wizards or sorcerers can cast as well. Despite being a universal death sentence, warlocks with [[the Bruqai]] as patrons are some of the most common full casters around, more common than those who learn through the magic academies since the Bruqs are diligent about getting recruits for their side.

#### Nobility and Privilege
-  Rank is based on the innate ability to do magic. Those born with the gift like sorcerers are considered the highest form of mage and envied. Those who had to study just to learn basic magic are considered lesser though with sufficient proficiency this attitude can change. As a result those who gained their magic from a natural connection to [[The Dawnforge]] like Clerics and Druids are considered better than Wizards who are seen as people trying to force and affinity with [[The Dawnforge]] as opposed to forging it naturally.

Commoners are expected to study magic. Most don't have the time or desire to spend hours learning it though they have an understanding of how it works. Some commoners, specifically those with a business incentive to learn, spend dozens of hours practicing in order to learn a cantrip. Since normal commoners don't have the same natural mastery of the weave as adventurers do, they can't cast these cantrips at will. It takes a lot out of them so can only cast it a handful of times a day. How much they can cast depends on their experience with magic. Those who just recently learned can only cast once per long rest. Those with a few years of experience can cast twice, those with a decade or two can cast 3 times. Those who have consistently been using it most of their life can cast at will. Learning magic is like learning a language. If you don't lose it you lose it. Rich children from Crystalshore learn magic in school and need to have at least 1 cantrip mastered in order to graduate. Most forget these cantrips though may be able to conjure up a minor and weak effect if they put enough effort into it. Those that learn Friends, Message and Minor Illusion are more likely to remember these cantrips but their rare use makes it a substantial effort to conjure and they can only do it once per day.

In order to even cast a cantrip, someone needs to be above average intelligence. Anyone can technically get to be a level 1 wizard thorough a 5 year intensive course in university. But this is very expensive and difficult and only the cream of the crop are able to make it through. Understanding magic well enough to wield it is very difficult and requires intense study of the arcane and a brilliant enough mind to grasp all of the interconnections of these spells. Similar to understanding pure math or theoretical physics.

## History
- 






Sorcerers are the highest type of caster in Turul since they have the natural affinity for magic. It's divine soul sorcerers that are the most respected and being one is the ticket into power. Every Grand Archonate has been a divine soul sorcerer or at least has claimed to be one.

There's a town in Turul occupied only by women because of the patriarchal nature of the archonate. They use magic to reproduce. The spell is called [[Custom Spells#Divine Conception|Divine Conception]].
