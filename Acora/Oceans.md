### Bioluminescence
The oceans of [[Acora]] are filled with bioluminescent life even close to the surface. This is because of the shadows cast by rings around the planet. Most of the latitudes of the ocean for a significant portion of the year is cast in darkness for months at a time. There is no light just a few metres below the surface making bioluminescence a requirement to survive for those months. This leads to the oceans often glowing with life especially during the spring spawning seasons.

### The Boiling Depths
This sea is relatively shallow compared to the other oceans on the planet with an average depth of 2 km. These seas are warmer than usual ranging from luke warm to boiling. It's located between latitude 50N and 20N in the sea between [[Deslea]] and [[Grudor]]. There are many small islands in this region most new and barren of any form of life. Massive ocean geysers are a common occurrence here making it dangerous to traverse as they come with little warning. A few moments before a geyser burst the sea becomes scaldingly hot. This gives a ship only seconds to get out of the path of the geyser or be destroyed. As a result, this ocean is almost never crossed despite being the shortest route between Wraekai and Valdor. 

The activity is caused by the thin crust on the ocean floor and highly active volcanic activity that heats the oceans and creates boiling geyser that shoot violently out of the surface. These geysers can be as high as 200m and be seen from kilometres away.

### The Painted Sea
The ocean between [[Magnarch]] and [[Waymarch]] has a high density of pigmented phytoplankton. During the zenith months in high light, the oceans become a blood red as the phytoplankton produce phycoerythrin pigments that absorb the green and blue lights that are plentiful in high light conditions. This results in them reflecting red light turning the sea red. During the umbra when these wavelengths aren't as plentiful, phycoerythrin stops being produced and chlorophyll production increases causing the sea to turn green. In between these states during the half shadow, the sea briefly turns a golden yellow. The high levels of phytoplankton attract a lot of animals which results in the red and green seas being illuminated from below causing the ocean to shimmer.

The ocean is still the widest and roughest on [[Acora]] second only to the Boiling Depths. Gales are a daily occurrence and waves can reach 40 m. Only the toughest ships can make the journey across. These storms are far worse and more common during the zenith giving the Painted Sea the nickname The Bloodied Deep by sailors due to all the lives it has claimed. The storms aren't as bad during the umbra, but the darkness allows pirates to attack with little warning bringing a new danger to the seas.
