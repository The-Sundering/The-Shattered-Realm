## Government

#### Government Type
- Oligarchic council of merchant-lords and mine-owners
- Grudorian overseers monitor major policy decisions related to trade and military matters

#### Nobility and Privilege
- Titles of nobility are linked to wealth from mining claims rather than ancient bloodlines
- Land ownership is less prestigious than mine ownership
- Large merchant houses and smithing guilds dominate politics

#### Capitol City
- Cragcoast 

#### Crime and Punishment
- Property crimes (especially ore theft) are severely punished
- Forced labor in the mines is a common sentence for criminals
- Smuggling ore without reporting it to [[Grudor]] authorities is considered treason and is punishable by death

#### Allies and Adversaries
- Formal protectorate relationship with [[Grudor]]
- Tense relations with [[Turul]], who view Pyril’s ore supply as bolstering [[Grudor]]’s military
- Close relations with [[Magnarch]]
- Minimal direct conflict with other nations

#### Infrastructure
- Extensive underground tunnels connect major mines
- Major cities are built within mountains and are protected from the earthquakes that plague the rest of Pyril
- Road networks are rough but functional, designed mainly for heavy cargo transport

#### Military
- Small, heavily armored defensive forces stationed at mines and port cities
- [[Grudor]] maintains auxiliary forces ready to deploy in Pyril if needed
- Military focus is on defense and guarding resource hubs, not expansion

## Economy

#### Bruqai Bestowment
- First nation taught advanced mining, smelting, and forging techniques
- Early access to superior metallurgy has kept Pyril valuable to [[Grudor]]

#### Natural Resources
- Rich deposits of iron, copper, gold, silver, and gemstones
- Limited arable land, leading to dependence on imported food

#### Trade, Guilds and Market
- Mining Guilds oversee the extraction and initial trade of ores
- Merchant houses control shipping and external trade contracts
- [[Grudor]] has preferential access to Pyrilian ore through protected trade agreements

#### Technology and Medicine
- Highly advanced metallurgy and forging techniques for the era
- Medicine is rugged and practical, focused on treating mining injuries

#### Transportation and Communication
- Shipping is done by sea using Grayshorian vessels that can transport large amounts of ore and finished items to [[Magnarch]] and coastal cities in [[Grudor]].
- Travel inland is limited to shortest paths from mines to a coast.
- Without wheels, Pyril relies on sleds pulled by the largest animals they can find.
	- They don't have advanced taming or breeding techniques so attacks by work animals is a common occurrence
- Communication is slow and primarily by courier across mountain passes
- Roads rarely exist between settlements so travel is restricted to through the forests and swamps of Pyril

#### Farming
- Farming is limited to coastal terraces and valley enclaves
- Primarily subsistence crops: hardy grains, root vegetables, and goats for meat and milk
- Most food is imported from [[Magnarch]] or [[Grudor]]

#### Export/Import
- Major exports: iron, copper, silver, gold, gemstones, forged goods
- Major imports: food, cloth, transportation, military

## Culture

#### Art and Entertainment
- Stone carving, gem cutting, and intricate metalwork are highly prized arts
- Storytelling about mining legends and heroic expeditions into deep tunnels is a common pastime
- Public competitions in smithing and mining strength are major events

#### Architecture
- Heavy stone construction; buildings are squat, thick-walled, and built to endure storms and earthquakes
- Elaborate underground halls are common among wealthier mine-owners

#### Ethics
- Hard work, resourcefulness, and loyalty to one's guild or house are the highest virtues
- Ore theft and dishonoring trade agreements are seen as grave moral failings
- Wealth is openly admired as proof of strength and cleverness

#### Fashion and Dress
- Practical and rugged clothing: thick leather tunics, wool cloaks, heavy boots
- Wealthier citizens wear jewelry crafted from local metals and gemstones
- Guild badges or house crests are commonly worn

#### Holidays
- Oreweigh (a midwinter festival where miners present their finest finds for blessings)
- Forgefire Festival (marking the first smelting of the year with public feasts and smithing contests)

## Customs

#### Religion
- The dominant faith in Pyril is [[The Stonebound Creed]], a religion centred on the reverence of stone, metal, and the veins of ore beneath the land.
- Followers believe the stone is a living force that grants bounty to the respectful and punishes the greedy.
- Daily prayers before mining, forging, or stonecutting are widespread, and major communal rites occur when new mines are opened or major works completed.
- Minor foreign faiths, especially the Sanctum of the Sea, exist in port cities but hold little power inland.

#### Religious Tolerance
- Generally tolerant toward foreign religions, provided they do not dishonour the stone, obstruct mining work, or defile sacred sites.
- Proselytization by outside faiths is frowned upon, especially attempts to sway miners or smiths from [[The Stonebound Creed]].

#### Secularism
- Governance in Pyril is officially secular, controlled by merchant lords and mine-owners.
- However, [[The Stonebound Creed]] strongly influences cultural norms, public ceremonies, and even legal traditions relating to property rights over land and ore veins.

#### Temples
- Temples to [[The Stonebound Creed]] are carved directly into cliffsides, mountains, and deep within active mines.
- These sanctuaries are austere and enduring, often featuring uncut stone altars, ironwork symbols, and sacred relics crafted from the first ore of a mine.
- Shrines are also common in mining camps, smithies, and even merchant halls, marked by rune-inscribed stones or small iron icons.

## Magic

#### Laws on Magic
- Magic is strictly illegal across all of Eastrun, including Pyril.
- Possession of magical artifacts, use of spells, or the study of magic is punishable by heavy fines, imprisonment, or forced labor in the mines.
- Public officials and merchant lords are required by law to report any suspected magic use immediately to Grudorian overseers.
- Magical contraband, when discovered, is typically destroyed or seized for examination by [[Grudor]].

#### Magical Tolerance
- The general population views magic with fear and deep suspicion, associating it with instability, deceit, and forbidden power.
- Superstitions about magic causing mine collapses, bad ore yields, or cursed veins are widespread among miners and merchants alike.
- However, small underground pockets of magic users persist, especially among outcasts, isolated mountain clans, or hidden sects operating far from major cities.
- Some wealthy merchant houses secretly seek to harness minor magical talents (e.g., dowsing for ore, strengthening tools) despite the risks, but such practices are rare and highly secretive.

#### Magic in Warfare
- Magic has no official role in Pyrilian military or defense forces.
- Magical artifacts, when captured, are usually handed over to Grudorian authorities or locked away in heavily guarded vaults.
- Rogue magic users found assisting enemy forces or engaging in sabotage are executed swiftly without trial.

## History
- Pyril was among the first nations to receive direct bestowment from [[the Bruqai]], learning mining and forging techniques that gave them immense early wealth.
- Despite early independence, Pyril fell under [[Grudor]]’s influence as the Empire expanded, agreeing to protectorate status to secure their autonomy in exchange for a steady supply of ore.
- While tensions occasionally flare between independent-minded miners and Grudorian inspectors, Pyril has remained a loyal and critical supplier to the [[Grudor]] Empire's military and economic might.
