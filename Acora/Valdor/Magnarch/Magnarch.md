## History
Grayshore is a detachment from Waymarch. In the early days when they had just invented the ship, some Grayshore explorers travelled to Valdor and settled there against the advice of the Bruqai who knew the threat Grudor posed. Soon after Grayshore was conquered, it was only because of their knowledge of ship building that they were able to maintain some sovereignty. After that Grayshore was cut off by its Bruqai. It couldn't risk letting technology that could bring the Grudor to Wayshore fall into Grudors hands. So it stopped providing books, destroyed Grayshore's ships along with all the written manuscripts that could be found by that Bruqai's people.

Grudor's Bruqai argued that any more interference with Grudor would be in direct violation of the natural advancement of another groups people. This is one of the laws they have. Only your own people can be interfered with directly. Once that Bruqai abandoned Grayshore it ceased to be their people anymore. 

As a result, the few manuscripts that managed to be saved by Grayshore are not allowed to be interfered with though the Grayshore Bruqai argues that it's a result of their work so shouldn't count. Members of his group are still trying to find that today. As a result of all of this Elindir and Bruqai are hated in Grayshore.

The only reason Grayshore has managed to keep it's sovereignty is because Grudor still believes that it's getting new bestowments. So their abandoment is a well kept secret and imports from Waymarch go for a lot of money.
