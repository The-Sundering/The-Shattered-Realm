## Geography

#### Regional Divisions
- Divided into Military Districts, each led by a Warlord-Governor ("Primarch"): Saltend, Kalmaer, Kensingtree, and Windgard
- Wolfgarde functions as both capital and symbolic heart of Grudor.
- New Grudor is an occupation zone of Grudor on Breiforia
- The Glacial Frontiers is a new colony on the Northern island above Windgard.

#### Climate
- Temperate, with cold autumns, mild summers, and snowy winters in the north.
- Rain-heavy springs and cool breezes from the northern mountains.

#### Terrain and Landscape
- Rugged northern mountains (The Warcrow Peaks)
- Vast pine forests (The Blackwood Expanse)
- Fertile lowland plains (The Ironreach)
- Deep rivers used for transport and trade

#### Notable Locations
- The Warcrow Peaks: Mythologized mountain range known for harsh trials and ancient battle sites.
- The Fields of Ironreach: Historic training grounds for legions.
- The Vault of Eternity: The Hall of Heroes in Wolfgarde featuring stone carvings of all the greatest heroes of Grudor. Each carving includes a bust of the hero and a chiselled epitaph detailing all of the great deeds they've done in service to Grudor.
- The Aegisian Artery: A long river that spans Valdor and connects Wolfgarde and Basincliff. It's the main way to transport goods and people between the country.
- Ruins of Drakmeer: The ancestral seat of power for the Drakai empire that has fallen to ruin after the end of the Ashen Rebellion.

#### Flora and Fauna
Grudor has some of the most inhospitable flora and fauna on Grudor. Most of the Grudor wildnerness is trying to kill you. This is why the people there were so strong before [[The Bruqai]] even came. This is the last vestige of dinosaurs on Bruqai. 

Valdor has a history of heavy volcanic activity which lead to an extinction event that killed most herbivores. This created an absence of food for secondary consumers and heavy competition leading to fierer predators. This in turn lead to herbivores investing heavily in more aggressive defences. The lack of plants lead to largely barren soil that reduces the ability of plants to grow on it leading to heavy grazing by herbivores so the plants are toxic as well. Most of these effects were concentrated in Grudor despite the volvanic activity coming from [[Pyril]]. The volcanic ash in [[Pyril]] helped fertilize the soil and prevent the long term drop in primary productivity while While the ocean air in [[Magnarch]] increased percipitation and facilitated more plant growth. As a result most of the life in Grudor is deadly leading to Grudorians needing to be tougher to survive which is what drew the attention of the Strength Bruqai.

Other common fauna include Owlbears, Giant Eagles, 

#### Environmental Hazards
- Rockslides and avalanches in mountain regions
- Heavy seasonal flooding in lower plains

## Government

#### Government Type
- Imperial rule through might and succession by force

#### Nobility and Privilege
- Titles are military-earned, not inherited, but in order to have true power you must leave the military officially to dedicate your time to politics.
- The highest ranking person in Grudor is the emperor who answers to no one though chooses a group on consuls to aid in their decision making. These consuls are typically ones they met while serving in the military.
- Province leaders are called Warlords and they have absolute say over everything that happens in their province they answer only to the emperor or their consuls on political matters or Mauls and higher ranking official on military matters.
- The best way to get a place in nobility is to kill the person you wish to succeed. If you succeed, you're rewarded and get their title. If you fail, you'll die a dishonourable death as their indentured servant until you grow old and frail.

#### Capitol City
- Wolfgarde

#### Crime and Punishment
- Swift and brutal; death or forced labour are common punishments.
- The death penalty is designed to give a dishonourable death. In the past there was death by gladitorial combat, but with the punishment being death in a blaze of glory and battle it served as a poor deterrent, even encouraging some crimes for hopes of coming out triumphant.
- This is why deaths are now designed to be humiliating such as servitude to those you wronged without food or water until you die. 
	- Dying on public display with the crimes written on your back is a common one as well as people humiliate you until your death. 
	- Being forced into death combat unarmed and killed by an elderly soldier or a teenager is common too.
- Before any death sentence, all the belongings of the criminal along with any record of their existence is burned so they will be forgotten to time.
- Being challenged to the death is a legal means of seeking justice for any perceived wrong doing.
	- Denying such a challenge forces involvement from the local authorities which typically side aginast the one challenged.

#### Allies and Adversaries
- Actively hostile to all other powers, especially [[Turul]] and [[Calythrahra]].
- Protectorates like [[Magnarch]] and [[Pyril]] are heavily monitored and heavily distrusted.

#### Infrastructure
Infrastructure is limited with most money being put into the military. Buildings are simple and practical being quick to erect and quick to flee in the event of a raid. Roads are simple dirt tracks and little money is put into defence as that's seen as cowardly. The only defence is combat with protection coming from the tip of a sword not a fortified wall. 

#### Military
The military is the heart of the empire. It is the most heavily invested in section of the nation. Everyone is forced to serve for 2 years between the ages of 16 and 18 so they all receive some military training. After this point, leaving is allowed but considered cowardly unless it is to do a job that supports the military in some way such as farming or arms manufacturing. You can also be kicked out of the military for being weak or cowardly at which point you are permanently marked for life and have very little social status.

##### Ranks
The Grudorian military uses a tiered rank system, divided into two main branches:
- **Legions** (infantry and siege)
- **Warbeasts** (beastmasters and heavy cavalry)

Ranks are generally standardized across branches but with small branch-specific additions.

## Culture

#### Art and Entertainment
- Gladiatorial games and duels are popular public entertainment.
- Historical retellings of great battles are the closest things to art in Grudor as a form of entertainment.
- Art is looked down upon as a waste of time.
- Telling stories of the great deeds of their ancestors.
- Kaul is the first sport on [[Acora]] and very popular across the country. The name comes from the warlord that invented it as a way to strengthen his forces. Every major town has an arena where local teams play with the biggest one coveted by all players being in Wolfgarde. The emperor regularly attends these games. The game is played with 2 teams each equipped with the dipper which is a long stick with a cupped end to hold the ball. The handles are commonly made of bone whole the bowl is made of carved wood and often covered in spikes. The game starts with one team getting the ball this is decided by a coin flip. The offensive team needs to get the ball into the hole by carrying it on their dippers and not letting the ball touch the ground. If they can get the ball through the vertical ring they score one point. The defensive team must either knock the ball to the ground so they get possession of the ball and go on offense or to steal the ball from the other team without it touching the ground. If they successfully steal the ball and score they get 3 points. When the ball touches the ground the offensive team loses 1 point. If the ball falls during a steal the team loses 2 points making stealing a high risk high reward strategy. To prevent the ball from getting through the ring, any means are allowed short of murder. This makes the game a very violent sport. Clubbing with the dippers is common along with tackling and fighting. No outside weapons can be brought in and no headshots are allowed with the dipper. Defensive equipment is not allowed. Most players only last about a season due to the injuries they succumb to though they're considered local heroes after the fact if their team was good. Playing a bad game routinely results in fights breaking out between fans and players that fans very rarely win.
	- Every kid grows up playing this game. The dippers are typically shovels or custom made with a stick and a basket. Balls are made with stitched up cloth and stuffed with hay. Getting a real dipper like the pros use earns major bragging rights.

#### Architecture
- Simple and practical houses that are quick to build make up a majority of the structures in Grudor.
- The most intricate buildings are military bases and the emperor's palace in Wolfgarde.
- These buildings are still blocky and brutalist

#### Ethics
Absolute loyalty to the empire is a requirement in daily life, even slight questions about the empire's efficacy or justness are considered an act of betrayal that will be reported to local authorities. Being a member of the military is the greatest thing a person can do if they remain after the 2 year compulsory service. Anyone who leaves the military is looked down upon even by those who left themselves. There's a sort of cognitive dissonance where they believe they left for the right reason while others are just cowards that don't want to fight for their country. 

Violence is celebrated and considered the best means of handling conflicts. Shying away from a duel is the most cowardly thing a person can do that leads to ostracization. Among all members of the military and many civilians, death is not to be feared as long as it's an honourable one. This is officially supposed to mean a death in service to Grudor. Though many people, especially young ones have twisted it to mean any death that can be earned head on with a blade in their hand. Death by gladitorial combat had to be done away with for this reason, a glorious death was envied especially for those not in the military that are unlikely to have one otherwise. Gladiator fights gave a means for troubled youths to die honourably and make something of themselves.

A legacy is all that matters in Grudor. You are only what you can leave behind. This means having children is of the utmost importance, telling stories of the exploits of your ancestors is a primary pasttime among families and the most frequent way parents bond with their children. Trophies, medals and other memorabilia are preserved and mounted in family homes. Some can be traced back centuries. It's a grave crime to ever throw one away and it's believed the ghost of that ancestor will haunt whoever does it. The greatest gift is to have your name in the hall of heroes, the closest thing to a library that exists in Grudor. Every city has one for the greatest fighters that have lived or served there. Getting entered in there is the Grudorian equivalent to immortality with the greatest honour being Wolfgarde's Hall which holds records of all the greatest Grudorians to ever serve the empire. Destroying a legacy is worse than death itself which is why the death penalty will always come by first destroying all the records of the person's existence. Any children the person has will be told their parent was a nobody unworthy of praise or tribute. Any properly raised child will always take an imperial solder at their word even over their own parent.

#### Fashion and Dress
- Functional and durable: leather, chain, dark wool, and reinforced battle cloaks.
- War medals are typically worn as a part of everyday dress to proudly display their achievements even minor ones that aren't that impressive.
- The fashion in Wolfgarde amongst the rich that don't serve is typically military chic. They're modelled to look similar to the uniforms of high ranking officers but with a more sophisticated and expensive looking design. Wearing medals they earned during compulsory service is much more frequent here than it is for commoners. 

#### Holidays
- Fealty Festival: This is a nationwide festival that every town participates in where all citizens swear an oath of loyalty to the empire. This oath is about maintaining their strength so they can fight till their death. In the month leading up to the festival, people diligently make or buy presents. These presents are given to anyone that defeats them in a duel. Parents will often intentionally lose duels to their children or anyone they wish to gift a present to. Strangers also commonly duel each other with at least a few presents being set aside for people they don't know that have widespread appeal. Fights are not deadly and don't typically draw blood amongst commoners. Though in the military they are hard battles as is required by higher ups though they're still never crippling or deadly. Gladiator battles also take place every fealty day in every town. The battles in the smaller towns are typically more tame and never deadly since it's usually between two strong but important local figures. Battles in large towns are to the death and draw people from all across Grudor. The winner is given all the ungiven gifts people still have from the duels they won which makes this day incredibly lucrative for the winners.
- Day of Reckoning: This is about preparing for the Reckoning - the day Grudor finally rids the world of their ancestral enemies, [[the Bruqai]] and [[Turul]]. Rage against all enemies that seek to harm Grudor or keep them from their greatness is stoked. Effigies of Bruqai and Turulians are dragged then burned in the street. Some are quartered by horses while many are set up around cities to be used as target practice. Hunts are conducted around the nation to find and kill any Bruqai or mages hanging about. Higher up Bruqai send down some grunts as bait to fuel the strength of Grudorians without putting themselves in direct danger. Mages go into hiding on this day though no one who is knowledgable of the arcane is public about it unless they have the power to stop anyone who tries to come for them. Any magic books are burned and blackmarket sellers are sure to hide any of these books diligently for the searches.

## History
The tribes of Wolfgarde were the first to be granted Bruqai power in 27 SU. They were given advanced weaponry and military tactics by the [[Krakqai]] and became the first real military on [[Acora]]. They used this knowledge to expand and conquer much of their area. Different tribes in the area were also given these tactics with the Krakqai bestowing different weaponry upon different groups to increase the strategy and training required to with these wars. Much of the area that's now known as Grudor was plagued with war as different nations ruled by warlords rose and fought for territory. By 127 SU, the wardlord Draktier with his close ties to the Kraqai and brutal military strategy took over the area now known as Grudor. He named it Drakai. What's now known as [[Magnarch]] was also under this empire at the time and their ship making prowess was put to good use as these ships were used to cross [[Oceans|the boiling depths]] by island hopping and conquering Wraekai. 

By 178 SU, they conquered much of the continent with the exception of [[Calythra]] because no one else had yet been granted any power to defend themselves against the sheer force of the Draekai empire. The continent was named Wraekai after its emperor and much of Draekai's culture including its calendar were shared with the people of Wraekai. The [[Arqai]] had just arrived on [[Acora]] in 98 SU and [[Turul]] was just grasping first and second level spells so they didn't yet have the power to fight off Draekai. By 202 SU, once Turulians had begun to learn 3rd level spells they posed a fight against Draekai rule, especially with their resources stretches so thin as they conquered almost every corner of [[Acora]]. Thus begun [[The Ashen Rebellion]], a bitter war lasting 100 years that began with [[Turul]] putting up a fight against the Draekai incursion and eventually resulting in all the countries of [[Acora]] to rise up against the Draekai. This war set the world ablaze for 100 years and finally ended with the defeat of Draekai. The final blow came from within as Draktier's son Drakchor was killed by General Grudor in a coup to seize power. His first act as emperor was pulling out all his troops from Wraekai and forging treaties with the other nations of Valdor so they could maintain their sovereignty while still ensuring they had control over the resources these nations produced.
