The Architects (as referred to by Acorans) or the Paragons (as referred to by other Bruqai)
## Aketheos | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Empiricism**|Paradigm of Empiricism]]
Aketheos is a figure of cold reason tempered by paternalistic devotion. More than any other Architect, he sees his Chosen not as pawns in a cosmic contest but as children entrusted to him, fragile minds in need of guidance and discipline. His logic is unyielding, his judgment calm, yet beneath that composure lies an almost desperate fear of watching another golden age collapse into ignorance and barbarism, as he has seen countless times before. 

To him, deviation from Empiricism is not only betrayal but self-destruction—when his people stray toward conquest, superstition, or indulgence, he is less wrathful than wounded. His punishments reflect that philosophy: never executions, but humiliating “corrections,” twisting dissenters into dull, childish parodies of themselves as living warnings of the dangers of false paradigms. 

Aketheos despises Conquest above all, seeing it as the epitome of regression, and holds deep contempt for Profit, Stewardship, and Artifice as wasted potential—but he reserves a grudging respect for Arcana, a sibling lens on truth. His fleet operates as a meritocracy, brutally fair in its logic: brilliance rises, incompetence falls, predation on the intellect of his people is punished with merciless finality. Above all, Aketheos is the Architect who takes his failures most personally—every lapse into ignorance is not just a blow to his pride, but a wound to his very purpose.

## Varroth | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Conquest**|Paradigm of Conquest]]
**Varroth, The Siege Lord,** is flamboyant, proud, and aggressive, but not a mindless butcher — he is the embodiment of the belief that strength and discipline forge not only soldiers, but better people. To him, the military life is the crucible where disparate cultures can be broken down and reforged into a single, loyal unit, bound by shared hardship and martial camaraderie. He preaches that the world is dangerous and treacherous, and only by conquering all enemies can true safety and flourishing be secured. 

Honour, for Varroth, is both ideal and pragmatism: dishonourable soldiers poison the unity he strives for, while honourable warriors can win the trust of the conquered and turn them into comrades. He believes feats of strength and merciless responses to disobedience are necessary — a lapse in discipline or obedience earns swift, public execution — yet he is not wantonly cruel. Unlike other warlords, he understands that excessive punishment corrodes loyalty, so he tempers brutality with respect for those who serve faithfully, even if they fail. 

He holds contempt for Arcana, believing magic to be fleeting and unreliable compared to the permanence of muscle, steel, and discipline, and he dismisses Stewardship and Artifice as hollow pursuits of beauty and preservation. Science and Profit, however, he views as useful tools to fuel war. His fleet is a tightly disciplined meritocracy, where advancement comes not from murdering rivals but from strength, loyalty, and performance; camaraderie within the ranks is sacred, and distrust is reserved for the enemy alone. Varroth does not see himself as a villain, but as a bringer of peace through conquest — a unifier who believes war is the only path to lasting safety, honour, and unity.

## Aurvein | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Profit|Paradigm of Profit]]
**Aurvein, Lady of Gold,** is the most outwardly charismatic of the Architects and the least trusted. In her former lives she was a capitalist, economist, and merchant-prince, and she still carries that identity into her current existence. She believes herself to be a superior being precisely because of her ability to manipulate systems of wealth: the intellect to calculate, the charm to persuade, and the will to secure power through commerce. To her, profit is not just a paradigm — it is proof of inherent worth. Those who succeed in amassing wealth deserve their station, while those who fail are lesser creatures, unfit for more than service. This superiority complex is what makes her treat her most accomplished Chosen as near-equals: only fellow capitalists, whose philosophies mirror her own, can stand even close to her level. She protects these rare individuals fiercely, while the common masses beneath them mean nothing to her.

Aurvein’s great weapon is her charisma. She can charm almost anyone at first meeting, drawing them into her orbit and turning them against her rivals with nothing more than a word or a smile. Of all the Architects, she is the easiest to like upon first impression — and the quickest to despise once her true nature reveals itself. She thrives on manipulation, sowing distrust and pitting allies against each other whenever it benefits her, and for centuries she has profited by stirring drama and playing factions off one another. This endless lying and scheming has left her utterly isolated: while the other Architects may loathe each other’s paradigms, they at least maintain collegial relations; none will share a table with Aurvein unless forced. She is begrudgingly included in tournament councils and strategy debates, but the others prefer to address her Primarch, who is considered far more trustworthy. Nobody believes her word when it concerns another Architect, and her reputation as a manipulator ensures she is forever excluded from camaraderie.

Her attachment to her fleet is tenuous at best. With the advent of replicators and faster than light travel, her people live in a post-scarcity environment where coin and trade have no real meaning. Aurvein finds it impossible to relate to them — they are no more than passengers in her enterprise — and so she largely ignores them. The care and management of the fleet is delegated to her Primarch, who acts as the humane counterpart she has no patience for. Aurvein reserves her energy and attention for her Chosen, the rare accomplished merchants and schemers she views as ideological comrades, and for the endless pursuit of new avenues of profit.

She has always been fiercely loyal to her paradigm, insisting that Profit underlies every other. Where Conquest, Empiricism, Arcana, and Artifice chase glory in their own spheres, Aurvein understands that all of them can be bent toward commerce: inventions patented, monuments commissioned, and war can secure new lands and people to exploit. In her view, profit is the universal language, the true blood that flows through every paradigm. Yet from the beginning she was denied the breadth of this vision. The other Architects, wary of letting her claim too much, forced her to confine her bestowments to logistics, transport, and communication — the arteries of trade, but nothing more. This restriction has left her with a cold disinterest in her bestowments. While other Architects revel in giving their people a new sword, a dazzling invention, or a gleaming work of art, Aurvein doles out caravans and merchant ships with little joy. To her, these are not triumphs, only necessities. Her true passion lies elsewhere — in the marketplace itself, in the manipulation of contracts, monopolies, economies, and human desires.

She despises Stewardship, which denies exploitation and protects the very resources she would commodify, and the feeling is very much mutual. She sees Conquest and Empiricism as valuable allies at times, able to generate new markets and technologies for her to monopolize. Magic, too, can be a useful tool so long as it can be bought and controlled. Though it's Artifice that she truly cherishes and envies the most. While she disagrees with the principle of creating art for the sake of it, she craves the beauty and ornament that Profit cannot produce by itself — the opulent architecture, the gleaming monuments, the finely crafted objects of luxury. She envies these works and surrounds herself with the pleasures of art, sex, food, and indulgence, all the things that make her existence feel gilded. 

What truly sets Aurvein apart, however, is her refusal to ever return home. The other Architects may dream of reclaiming their place in the Far Realm or proving their paradigms to their peers, but Aurvein has no interest in going back. She is not driven by pure philosophy, nor by a need for academic discourse with equals. She is driven by the experience of wealth and superiority in practice — by the daily proof that her way of life elevates her above others. Even if the contest were abandoned, she would remain on the Prime Material plane, continuing her games of wealth and manipulation until eternity.

## Zoryth | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Arcana|Paradigm of Arcana]]
**Zoryth, The Dawn-Touched** is a pompous tyrant whose arrogance comes from experience rather than delusion. He has studied [[The Dawnforge]] more deeply than any mortal alive, communed directly with the Forge Masters, and immersed himself in its currents until he knows its workings better than anyone short of the Forge Masters themselves. To him, mastery of the Forge is mastery of life and death — the very essence of creation. Those with the connection to command it are the only ones worthy of power. Because his knowledge and command surpass any other mortal’s, he considers himself one of the most powerful beings in the universe, just beneath the Forge Masters themselves, whom he acknowledges as his superiors.

That conviction makes him insufferable. He genuinely believes himself to be in a tier apart from mortals, and he carries himself with the absolute certainty that he is untouchable. Around other Architects he is tolerated — he is no more arrogant than they are, and arrogance is their shared language — but to mortals he is unbearable, more arrogant and pompous even than Aurvein.

His society is built on this philosophy of worth. Zoryth insists magic must never be made universally accessible. Power cheapened is power squandered. He refuses to lower the bar of entry, instead demanding that mortals elevate themselves to it. A society where “everyone knows magic” only has value if each individual reached that level through worthiness: innate affinity, intellectual strength, or sheer force of will. To him, the Forge chooses its vessels, and that choice must be honoured.

Zoryth prizes most those with natural affinity for the Forge — they are chosen by creation itself. These he elevates first, considering them living proof of superiority. Yet he does not dismiss the self-taught. Those who claw their way into magical mastery without a natural spark are respected as well, sometimes even valued more highly than a lazy or stagnant natural. Between two mages of equal accomplishment, however, the one with greater innate potential or drive will always rise higher in his estimation.

Those who wield magic fall under his absolute protection, especially those who excel. The finest Magisters he trains personally, grooming them within the limits of the Tournament rules to lead Turul and eventually Acora by example. He cannot hand them victory — that would violate the Architect’s law — but he can shape them, test them, and sharpen them into leaders fit to embody Arcana. Non-mages, by contrast, are of no concern. They are beneath his notice, existing only as backdrop to the hierarchy he values.

This natural order enforces itself in his domain. Those without affinity or discipline are cast down socially by their own peers, while those with the Forge’s spark rise to the highest councils. Zoryth himself polices the line of legitimacy, rooting out pretenders who falsely claim affinity. His fleet is ordered like his society: accomplishment in magic is the sole currency of respect, with hierarchies determined by affinity, learning, and discipline. It is meritocracy blended with magical essentialism, a ladder built to ensure Arcana remains the supreme Paradigm.

## Selvarra | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Artifice|Paradigm of Artifice]]
**Selvarra, The Muse Mother,** is the kindest of the Architects, the one people truly enjoy being around. She does not view her Chosen as lesser, but as citizens, artists, and people who deserve happiness. Her paradigm rests on the belief that when people are free to create, to pursue what brings them joy, they produce the most superior society. While others struggle with war, profit, or domination, her people thrive by beginning at the end goal of civilization — the post-scarcity state where art, craft, and study become the central pursuits of life. In her view, every society eventually arrives at artifice, so why not begin there?

Her tolerance has limits. Selvarra cannot abide those who would turn her people away from creation, whether by raising armies or by pushing them toward profit. When faced with such movements, she does not tolerate or compromise — she makes examples. Like Aketheos, she crafts symbolic punishments: a war-monger might be slain in a petty skirmish by his own ally, a profiteer undone by the greed of his partners. These examples demonstrate what becomes of those who reject her vision, ensuring her people see the futility of straying from creation.

Selvarra plays no favorites. She values all of her Chosen equally, from the humble artisan struggling to improve to the master craftsman who shapes wonders. Hidden among them, she spends time with each: nurturing the novice in ways allowed under the Tournament’s rules, listening to the master’s process, delighting in their joys and struggles alike. To her, every act of creation is sacred. The only ones she disregards entirely are those who create nothing and take no joy in creation. Even the cloth-weaver or the road-builder earns her esteem, but the man who refuses to craft or contribute is invisible to her.

Her philosophy extends beyond art into pleasure, though not into hedonism. She believes joy — in food, in celebration, in companionship — is essential for a thriving society, and she encourages her people to embrace it. Yet she herself does not indulge in excess, unlike Aurvein, whose decadence and commodification of art she despises. Profit is her true anathema. To Selvarra, the commodification of art kills its joy: when art is created for money, it ceases to be art and becomes exploitation. Profit, she believes, breeds suffering and strips creation of meaning. War she hates as well, for it kills not only bodies but the human spirit and the joy of making. Against these two paradigms, she is openly hostile. Toward others she is more neutral, though she regards Empiricism warily: it can achieve wonders in the late stages of a society, but if introduced too early, it too easily fuels destruction.

Her fleet reflects her nature. Unlike most others, they are joyful, creative, and mellow, protective of their paradigm but reluctant to harm without cause. Their sabotage is subtle, planting seeds of artistic yearning and questions in the minds of others — “why can’t we just do what we love?” Their hierarchies are based on ability, not brutality or favouritism: whoever can do the job best leads. Cruelty has no place among them, except when absolutely necessary to protect the paradigm itself.

For Selvarra, the pinnacle of society is simple: a world where every person is free to do what they love, to create for joy rather than necessity. To her, this is not utopia — it is inevitability. And so she builds it now, at the beginning, believing Artifice to be the true end state of every civilization.

## Druantia | [[Paradigms#**Paradigm of Stewardship|Paradigm of Stewardship]]
**Druantia, Shepard of the Wilds,** sees herself as the guardian of the wilds, a shepherd of cycles who has watched civilization after civilization rise and fall by disrespecting nature. She has seen oceans rise, soils collapse, air blacken, and people sicken because of greed, conquest, or unchecked progress. To her, the lesson is plain: every other Paradigm — Conquest, Empiricism, Artifice, Arcana, and most of all Profit — tears at the living Forge until nothing remains. She alone preserves the branch that all life sits upon.

Her philosophy is simple: what you put into the land, it returns. Protect the soil, maintain biodiversity, and rivers and forests will give back a thousandfold. While others boast of higher yields through conquest, machines, or arcane trickery, Druantia knows their harvests are doomed to collapse within years, leaving fields barren and waters poisoned. Her fields never exhaust, her waters remain clean, and her food is sought by those who have spoiled their own. More than practicality, she wields [[Sources of the Dawnforge#Natural Resonance|Natural Resonance]] — the raw Dawnforge energy radiating from every living being. Wizards may master formulae and patterns, but without a bond to living nature they cannot touch this current. Druantia can, and through it she draws power that multiplies harvests without stripping the land. In this she proves Stewardship stronger than all others.

She despises all rival Paradigms for their violence against the natural order, but reserves her greatest hatred for Profit. To Druantia, Profit is the purest engine of destruction, turning trees, beasts, and waters into numbers to be drained. Profit would strip forests bare for coin and poison rivers for short-term gain. It is anathema to everything she is. Against Profit she fights with her whole soul, and against those who follow it she shows no mercy.

Though she is the Shepherd, Druantia is not soft. She is militant in defence of her Paradigm, and tolerates no interference. Those who exploit or despoil the natural world do not receive lessons or symbolic examples as they would from Empiricism or Artifice — they are culled. Sometimes her punishments take the form of poetic justice, a poacher hunted by beasts, or a defiler drowned by his own dammed waters. Other times it is blunt execution. Either way, she makes it clear: exploitation of the living Forge is unacceptable.

For her followers she shows nothing but respect. Druantia does not treat them as subjects but as equals, co-caretakers of the world. She demands her fleets hold the same standard: no harm may come to those who walk in her Paradigm. And her fleets embody her militant activism. Unlike the more subtle sabotage of other Paradigms, Druantia’s followers act openly — slipping across borders to confront loggers, poachers, and despoilers directly. Many die violating treaties, but they do not waver, for they believe Stewardship is worth any cost. She esteems them deeply for this devotion.

Her governance is loose, less a hierarchy than a circle. Druantia encourages her people to live as they please so long as they honor balance. Authority exists, but it is organic, rooted in respect and knowledge, not rank or coercion. To her, civilization should not be rigid like stone walls or steel armies, but supple and enduring like groves, rivers, and seasons. She and her fleet are stewards, not rulers — shepherds who guide the flock of life along paths of harmony, and strike ruthlessly only when predators appear.
