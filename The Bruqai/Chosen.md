During the invasion of Acora, the people didn't have countries. They had their own cultures, tribes and crude technologies. Each architect selected a culture or group of cultures to bestow with their gifts. The descendants of these groups are The Chosen. The Chosen can change hands between [[Architects|architects]]. In order for a group to remain chosen they must have full control over how their technology is used and not share the same space with a different group of Chosen. This usually means having political control over an area. If a group of Chosen are conquered or willingly share knowledge of technology to a different group of Chosen then they will be expelled by their Architect. They may be taken in by another architect or left unchosen (Chaff) depending on their proficiency for the architect's paradigm.

Descendants of the chosen also inherit the title until they're no longer in a place where they have full control over their bestowments. At which point they're treated as Chaff until they regain dominance in their region again.
