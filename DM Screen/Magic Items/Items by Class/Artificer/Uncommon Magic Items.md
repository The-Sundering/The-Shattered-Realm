Optimized  
**All Purpose Tool +1**  
_Requires attunement by an artificer_  
This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the _Player's Handbook_ for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it. While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the tool's rarity.  
As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
 
**Ammunition +1**  
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.
 
**Cloak of Protection**  
_Requires attunement_  
You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.
 
**Deck of Illusions**  
This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.  
The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.  
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the _Monster Manual_), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.  
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.
 
**Dust of Corrosion**  
As an action, you can throw this dust into the air, filling a 10-foot cube that extends out from you. Surfaces and objects made of nonmagical ferrous metal in the area instantly corrode and turn to dust, becoming useless and unsalvageable. Any creature in the area that is made wholly or partly out of ferrous metal must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
Found in a small packet, this dust is made from finely ground rust monster antennae. There is enough dust in each packet for one use.
 
**Eversmoking Bottle**  
Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.  
The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.
 
**Eyes of the Eagle**  
_Requires attunement_  
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
 
**Goggles of Object Reading**  
_Requires attunement_  
These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.  
In addition, you can cast the [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell using the googles. Once you do so, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
 
**Headband of Intellect**  
_Requires attunement_

General  
**Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location**

**Amulet of the Drunkard**  
This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
 
**Bag of Holding**  
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.  
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.  
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a _Heward's Handy Haversack__,_ _Portable Hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
 
**Bag of Tricks**  
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.  
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See the _Monster Manual_ for the creature's statistics. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.  
The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.  
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Blood Spear**  
_Requires attunement_  
Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe Jived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and be lived underground. in battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first _blood spear_, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.

It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

**Cap of Water Breathing**

**Cloak of Elvenkind**  
_Requires attunement_

When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental) spell, and the gem's magic is lost.

- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.

If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead) spell.

**Potion of Giant Strength**  
When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). This potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  
This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The _potion of frost giant strength_ and the _potion of stone giant strength_ have the same effect.
 
**Potion of Greater Healing**  
You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can transform one of the robe's serpents into a **giant poisonous snake**. The snake instantly falls from the robe, slithers into an unoccupied space next to you, and acts on your initiative count. The snake can tell friendly creatures from hostile ones and attacks the latter. The snake disappears in a harmless puff of smoke after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you dismiss it (no action required). Once detached, a snake can't return to the robe. When all of the robe's snakes have detached, the robe becomes a nonmagical garment.

The creature takes 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
**Sending Stones**  
_Sending stones_ come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an action to cast the _sending_ spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell.  
Once _sending_ is cast through the stones, they can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.

**Soul Coin**  
_Soul coins_ are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each _soul coin_ has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.  
**Carrying Soul Coins.** To hold a _soul coin_ is to feel the soul bound within it — overcome with rage or fraught with despair.  
An evil creature can carry as many _soul coins_ as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A nonevil creature can carry a number of _soul coins_ equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of _soul coins_ greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.  
**Using a Soul Coin.** A _soul coin_ has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a _soul coin_ and use it to do one of the following:

- **Drain Life.** You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.
- **Query.** You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response. which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

**Freeing a Soul.** Casting a spell that removes a curse on a _soul coin_ frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from _soul coins_ typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.  
A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A _soul coin_ has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon (BG:DA, page 223) or an infernal war machine's furnace (BG:DA, page 217).  
Freeing a soul from a _soul coin_ is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.  
**Hellish Currency.** _Soul coins_ are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling. and reward the faithful for services rendered.  
_Soul coins_ are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.
