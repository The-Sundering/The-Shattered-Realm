**Blackrazor**  
_Requires attunement by a non-lawful alignment_  
Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, _Blackrazor_ shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.  
**Devour Soul.** Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by _Blackrazor_ can be restored to life only by a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell.  
When it devours a soul, _Blackrazor_ grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep _Blackrazor_ in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.  
If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, _Blackrazor_ devours your soul.  
**Soul Hunter.** While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be surprised, charmed or frightened.  
_Blackrazor_ can cast the [Haste](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:haste) spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.  
**Sentience.** _Blackrazor_ is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  
The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, _Blackrazor_ also understands every language you know.  
**Personality.** _Blackrazor_ speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. _Blackrazor_ is meant to hurry that process along.  
Despite its nihilism, _Blackrazor_ feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with _Whelm_ and finds _Wave_ tedious.  
_Blackrazor's_ hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.

**Fate Stone**
This stone is carved with a thatched pattern and is soft to the touch, feeling almost like woven fabric. It's imbued with the power of destiny, spun from the thread of the fates themselves. 

When you fail a d20 roll, you can choose to invoke the stone's power and treat the result as a critical success instead. You may then narrate the outcome of your action, shaping how the scene unfolds. However, the outcome must remain within the bounds of what would be possible on a natural 20 or a successful check.

- You cannot achieve impossible results—such as killing a powerful enemy outright or persuading someone to act wildly out of character—unless such outcomes would reasonably occur on a natural 20 or a high enough roll.

- For attack rolls, you may roll for a critical hit as normal.

- For spells or effects where success only halves damage, you still take that damage unless you have a feat that allows you to take no damage on a critical success.

The stone has 5 charges. Once all charges are expended, the stone disappears and leaves behind a bundle of mundane thread.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.  
All | [Fly](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fly), [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility), [Levitate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:levitate), [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good), plus the spells listed for the particular instrument

**Ioun Stone**  
_Requires attunement_  
An _Ioun stone_ is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of _Ioun stone_ exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.  
When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  
A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.  
**Greater Absorption (Legendary).** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  
Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are target by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.  
**Mastery (Legendary).** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.  
**Regeneration (Legendary).** You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.
   

**Iron Flask**  
This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.  
You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  
An [Identify](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify) spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.
   

**Jewel of Three Prayers**  
_Requires attunement_  
The _Jewel of Three Prayers_ is a Vestige of Divergence. In ancient times, Alyxian the Apotheon bore this amulet as a symbol of his covenant with three Prime Deities: Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart. When the jewel is found, only Sehanine’s power thrums within its dormant heart. The power of the other two deities waits to be reawakened by a hero - or heroes - who can follow in Alyxian’s footsteps.

    - As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the jewel’s charges to target yourself or one willing creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 15 feet of yourself, along with any equipment the target is wearing or carrying. The target appears in a flash of golden radiance, and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target’s new location must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes a 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.  
**Luck.** If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
**Wish.** The sword has 1d4- 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell from it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.
   

**Matalotok**  
_Requires attunement_  
_Matalotok_, the Frost Father, is an ancient hammer fashioned by Thyrm, the god of frost giants. The favored weapon of the demon lord Kostchtchie, _Matalotok_ is frigid to the touch and wreathed in mist.  
You are immune to cold damage while holding _Matalotok_. Whenever it deals damage to a creature, the hammer radiates a burst of intense cold in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.
   

**Plate Armor of Etherealness**  
_Requires attunement_  
While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the [Etherealness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:etherealness) spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.
   

**Platinum Scarf**  
_Requires attunement_  
This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.  
As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:  
**Breath of Life.** The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains 10d4 hit points.  
**Platinum Shield.** For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a +1 shield, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.  
**Radiant Hammer.** For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.  
Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don’t speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.
   

**Potion of Dragon's Majesty**  
This potion looks like liquid gold, with a single scale from a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon suspended in it. When you drink this potion, you transform into an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages, personality, and memories. You can’t use a dragon’s Change Shape or its legendary or lair actions.
   

**Potion of Giant Size**  
When you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or smaller, otherwise the potion does nothing. For that duration, your Strength becomes 25, if it isn't already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled (your current hit points are doubled when you drink the potion). In addition, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.  
Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of 1d8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of 1d10) when used with two hands.  
When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum become temporary hit points.  
This potion is a pale white liquid made from the tongue of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It tastes sweet, however, when consumed.
   

**Potion of Giant Strength**  
When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). This potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  
This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The _potion of frost giant strength_ and the _potion of stone giant strength_ have the same effect.  
Storm Giant | 29 | Legendary
   

**Rakdos Riteknife**  
_Requires attunement_  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.  
For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.  
The dagger has the following additional properties.  
**Siphon Vitality.** As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain 1d10 hit points per soul released.  
**Annihilation.** If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.
   

**Ring of Spell Turning**  
_Requires attunement_  
While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
   

**Ring of Three Wishes**  
While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the [Wish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish) spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
   

**Rod of Lordly Might**  
Requires attunement  
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.  
**Six Buttons.** You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  
If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a [Flame Tongue](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:flame-tongue) as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).  
If you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  
If you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  
If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  
If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants you a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.  
If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.  
**Drain Life.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
**Paralyze.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure , the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
**Terrify.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see with in 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
   

**Rod of Resurrection**  
_Requires attunement by a cleric, druid or paladin_  
This rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [Heal](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heal) (expends 1 charge) or [Resurrection](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:resurrection) (expends 5 charges.  
The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
   

**Ruby Weave Gem**  
_Requires attunement by a spellcaster_  
While you are holding this gem, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells.  
The gem has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this gem, you can expend up to 3 charges to ignore the spell’s material components with a gold piece cost, up to 500 gp per charge expended.  
When you finish a long rest, choose a spell from any class list. The spell you choose must be of a level you can cast. You know the chosen spell and can cast it with your spell slots of the appropriate level until the end of your next long rest.
   

**Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning**  
Using an action to read the scroll causes the tarrasque (see the creature's entry in the _Monster Manual_) to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 1 mile of you. The tarrasque disappears when it drops to 0 hit points and is hostile toward all creatures other than itself.
   

**Scroll of the Comet**  
By using an action to read the scroll, you cause a comet to fall from the sky and crash to the ground at a point you can see up to 1 mile away from you. You must be outdoors when you use the scroll, or nothing happens and the scroll is wasted.  
The comet creates a 50-foot-deep, 500-foot-radius crater on impact. Any creature in that radius must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. All structures in the crater are destroyed, as are all nonmagical objects that aren't being worn or held.
   

**Spell Bottle**  
_Requires attunement_  
This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1: the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.  
When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.  
While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.  
If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.
   

**Staff of the Magi**  
_Requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock or wizard_  
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.  
The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.  
**Spell Absorption.** While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).  
**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [Conjure Elemental](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental) (7 charges), [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic) (3 charges), [Fireball](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [Flaming Sphere](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flaming-sphere) (2 charges), [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) (4 charges), [Invisibility](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:invisibility) (2 charges), [Knock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock) (2 charges), [Lightning Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-bolt) (7th-level version, 7 charges), [Passwall](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:passwall) (5 charges), [Plane Shift](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) (7 charges), [Telekinesis](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis) (5 charges), [Wall of Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-fire) (4 charges), or [Web](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:web) (2 charges).  
You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: [Arcane Lock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:arcane-lock), [Detect Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic), [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce), [Light](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:light), [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), or [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good).  
**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.  
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Distance from Origin**|**Damage**|
|10 ft. away or closer|8 x the number of charges in the staff|
|11 to 20 ft. away|6 x the number of charges in the staff|
|21 to 30 ft. away|4 x the number of charges in the staff|
   

**Stormgirdle**  
_Requires attunement_  
A _Stormgirdle_ is a wide belt made of thick leather branded with the symbol of Kord. The girdle's clasps are made from dragon ivory.  
**Dormant.** While wearing the _Stormgirdle_ in its dormant state, you have resistance to lightning damage and thunder damage, and your Strength score becomes 21 if it isn't already 21 or higher. In addition, you can use an action to become a Storm Avatar for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits for the duration:

- You have immunity to lightning damage and thunder damage.
- When you hit with a weapon attack that normally deals bludgeoning damage, it deals thunder damage instead. When you hit with a weapon attack that normally deals piercing or slashing damage, it deals lightning damage instead.
- As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to be struck by lightning. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you use the girdle's Storm Avatar property, that property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
**Awakened.** While wearing the _Stormgirdle_ in its awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Strength score becomes 23 if it isn't already 23 or higher.
- Your Storm Avatar's lightning strike deals 4d6 lightning damage (instead of 3d6).
- While transformed into a Storm Avatar, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

- You can cast the [Control Weather](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-weather) spell from the girdle. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
   

**Sword of Answering**  
_Requires attunement by a creature of the same alignment as the sword_  
In the world of Greyhawk, only nine of these blades are known to exist. Each is patterned after the legendary sword Fragarach, which is variously translated as "Final Word." Each of the nine swords has its own name and alignment, and each bears a different gem in its pommel.  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have advantage on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any damage immunity or resistance the target has.
   

**Talisman of Pure Good**  
_Requires attunement by a creature of good alignment_  
This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.  
If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.  
The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.
   

**Topaz Annihilator**  
_Requires attunement_  
This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.  
The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a true resurrection or wish spell.  
While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the [Disintegrate](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:disintegrate) spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
   

**Vorpal Sword**  
_Requires attunement_  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.  
When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.
   

**Whelm**  
_Requires attunement by a dwarf_  
Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with _Whelm_, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.  
**Thrown Weapon.** _Whelm_ has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.  
**Shock Wave.** You can use an action to strike the ground with _Whelm_ and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
**Supernatural Awareness.** While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast [Detect Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) or [Locate Object](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:locate-object) object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.  
**Sentience.** _Whelm_ is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  
The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.  
**Personality.** _Whelm_'s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.  
_Whelm_ has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm.  
The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent _Whelm_ to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.
   

**Wreath of the Prism**  
_Requires attunement_  
This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.  
**Dormant.** While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.  
When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast [Dominate Monster](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster) on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.  
**Awakened.** Once the _Wreath of the Prism_ reaches an awakened state, it gains the following benefits:

- You can affect creatures of challenge rating 10 or lower with the wreath.
- The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 15.

**Exalted.** Once the _Wreath of the Prism_ reaches an exalted state, it gains the following benefits:

- You can affect creatures of challenge rating 15 or lower with the wreath.
- The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 17.
